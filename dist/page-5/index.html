              <h2>The One I Love</h2>
              <p>Warning: There be spoilers here. It&#39;s not possible to talk about <em>The One I Love</em> in a meaningful way without them. But it’s a movie best seen with an open mind. So I encourage you, if you haven&#39;t seen it, to do so. It&#39;s not perfect, but the first two acts are brilliant and it&#39;s original enough to warrant a look. Go ahead, I&#39;ll wait.</p>
<p>Back? Okay, here we go.</p>
<p>Mark Duplass and Elisabeth Moss play Ethan and Sophie, a young couple on the brink of divorce. They&#39;ve drifted apart. Their counselor sends them to a remote retreat for a weekend getaway. He believes it’s just what they need to reconnect and rediscover one another.</p>
<p>The retreat turns out to be a sizable country estate, complete with pool and guest house. Ethan and Sophie arrive and discover they&#39;re the only people present. They settle in, have a nice dinner, and smoke some marijuana.</p>
<p>Sophie wanders over to the guest house.  Ethan joins her. They laugh, talk and have a wonderful time. The best they&#39;ve had in years. They have sex. Later, Sophie heads back to the main house to grab some things. Inside, she&#39;s surprised to find Ethan lying on the couch.</p>
<p>She laughs and asks how he&#39;s beaten her back. Ethan looks confused. He&#39;s just woken up. Sophie stops laughing. She asks him why he&#39;s acting like this after they just has sex. Ethan looks at her with bewilderment. He tells her he&#39;s been asleep on the couch since they smoked the marijuana. Sophie storms off, furious at Ethan&#39;s unfunny joke.</p>
<p>Ethan wanders over to the guest house and falls asleep on the couch there. In the middle of the night, Sophie joins him. They snuggle. Ethan wakes to find Sophie making breakfast. Including bacon. Sophie hates bacon.</p>
<p>Up to this point, the film has cultivated a subtle aura of menace. The long shadow-filled shots of Sophie walking back to the house and through the empty kitchen wouldn&#39;t seem out of place in a home invasion thriller.</p>
<p>But now we&#39;ve got an inkling of what&#39;s going on, and to the film&#39;s credit, it doesn&#39;t drag things out.  Ethan and Sophie soon realize that when one of them enters the guest house alone, they&#39;re greeted by a doppelgänger of the other.</p>
<p>They run. Again, credit to the film. It&#39;s what most folks would do. But then Ethan and Sophie get to thinking about it. Especially Sophie. They talk. The film&#39;s tone shifts from menacing to quirky. Sophie suggests going back. Weren&#39;t they there to try new things? Ethan agrees. They return to the retreat and set some ground rules for the guest house. Fifteen minute sessions, no intimate activity. Total honesty.</p>
<p>Of course, these rules soon go out the window. Sophie begins sneaking out to see the other Ethan. Ethan ends up impersonating his doppelgänger in order to sleep with Sophie.</p>
<p>Later, Ethan gets some voicemails from friends and family members. The messages suggest that Ethan made a series of calls in the middle of the night asking random questions about his past. Some of his clothes seem to have gone missing as well.</p>
<p>Soon the doppelgängers confront Ethan and Sophie as a couple. The four try to have a nice dinner, but Ethan&#39;s suspicion and resentment bubble over. He storms off to the guest house. Once inside, he finds he can&#39;t get out.</p>
<p>In time, Sophie&#39;s doppelgänger arrives. Then the film falls apart.</p>
<p>Up to this point, the doppelgängers felt like a novel device the script employed to visualize Ethan and Sophie&#39;s perceptions of one another. This sort of thing could feel like a gimmick and veer into into cheesy fantasy, but the film stays grounded by focusing on the harsh realities of trying to make a relationship work.</p>
<p>To this end, the doppelgängers require no explanation. They exist to serve the story. The film even floats this notion, suggesting that some things “Just happen.”</p>
<p>But the movie isn&#39;t confident enough to leave it at that. And so Sophie&#39;s doppelgänger reveals the truth to Ethan. Her and Doppelgänger Ethan were another couple sent to the retreat like Ethan and Sophie, but now they&#39;re trapped. The only way they can leave is to break up Ethan and Sophie so they can take their place. But something&#39;s gone wrong. The other Ethan has fallen in love with the real Sophie. He&#39;s planning to leave with her.</p>
<p>After that wealth of exposition, the plot kicks in. Doppelgänger Sophie lets Ethan out of the guest house and distracts Doppelgänger Ethan (by posing as the real Sophie) so that Ethan can warn Sophie. When Sophie refuses to leave with him, Doppelgänger Ethan tries leaving by himself. An invisible wall knocks him cold. Ethan and Sophie leave.</p>
<p>The next we see, they&#39;re lying in bed giggling. Sophie gets up and offers to make breakfast, asking if Ethan wants bacon.</p>
<p>The film name-drops <em>The Twilight Zone</em> but the first two acts are more reminiscent of David Lynch&#39;s work.  Like Lynch&#39;s <em>Lost Highway (1997)</em> and <em>Mulholland Dr. (1999)</em>, <em>The One I Love</em> explores the subject of identity through a strange, inexplicable event. But the difference is that in Lynch&#39;s films, the character&#39;s motivations are never explicitly verbalized. If you define them, the rest of the story must serve them. When it doesn’t, you have plot holes.</p>
<p>And boy does <em>The One I Love</em> have a lot of them. The whole film doesn&#39;t make any sense, really. What was the point of imprisoning couples there? Why transform the previous couples into doppelgängers of the next ones? Why can they only leave after the other two have broken up? Why did their therapist send them in the first place?</p>
<p>Despite all this, <em>The One I Love</em> impressed me. It&#39;s a brilliant concept that&#39;s handled with the perfect tone. That it goes off the rails at the end doesn&#39;t detract from the great performances and it&#39;s biting insight into relationships. The plot holes don’t ruin the movie, they just handicap it.</p>
<p>Now, just imagine if it didn&#39;t try to explain the doppelgängers. Imagine if the scene where Ethan hears the other couple&#39;s voices turning into his and Sophie&#39;s was left out. Imagine if when Ethan confronted doppelgänger Sophie about not being real, she just sat and stared at him with that slightly unnatural smile. Then cut to the scene of Ethan and Sophie back home in bed laughing and Sophie getting up to make breakfast.</p>
<p>I suppose this ending would leave some portion of the audience wanting. Lynch’s films are famous for that. They’re like lego sets. They provide the audience with the building blocks of a story, but leave it to the viewer to create their own interpretation and meaning. Unfortunately, <em>The One I Love</em> is less like a set of legos and more like a puzzle. One that&#39;s missing a few pieces.</p>

              <h2>The Angry Hills</h2>
              <p><em>The Angry Hills</em> starts well enough. It&#39;s 1941. Robert Mitchum plays Mike Morrison, an American Correspondent who has just arrived in Greece. The Nazis are preparing to take the country and Mike plans to be on the next plane out. A member of the Greek resistance presents Mike with a list of Nazi collaborators. He urges Mike to take the list to British Intelligence. Mike declines, saying he doesn’t want to get involved. Later, while out with a friend, Mike discovers the list in his jacket.  Mike attempts to unload the list to another Greek agent, but Gestapo agents are already on Mike&#39;s tail. They force him to flee through the darkened back streets of Athens. Mike escapes by hitching a ride on a British convoy.</p>
<p>So far, so good. But then the film goes off the rails.</p>
<p>The script jumps ahead. We learn that the Germans bombed the British Convoy and that Mike survived thanks to some fishermen who took him to a remote village. <em>Then</em> the film jumps back and we see the convoy get bombed. Then we&#39;re back with Mike in a small Greek village.</p>
<p>These village scenes are dull and uninspiring. Stilted melodrama replaces suspense. A young, hotheaded female villager named Eleftheria nurses Mike back to health.</p>
<p>Once Mike is healthy, the film devolves into a clumsy wartime adventure. The villagers ask Mike to lead them on a raid of a Nazi supply depot. Because, who better to lead a guerrilla raid in the Greek countryside than an American journalist? While they&#39;re planning the raid, a British soldier shows up, says he&#39;d like to help, learns all the details about the raid, then leaves. No one is concerned. Of course, the raid goes bad. The Nazi&#39;s slaughter all the men save Mike and another, who manage to get away. When they can&#39;t understand what happened, we almost laugh.</p>
<p>After a bit, Mike and Eleftheria travel to a convent where Mike&#39;s given passage back to Athens. Once there, things get a little better, as the film shifts again, this time to a heist picture.</p>
<p>Lisa, a widowed British spy, is Mike&#39;s contact in Athens. The Gestapo gets wind of this and kidnaps Lisa&#39;s children. She&#39;s to turn over Mike if she wants to see her kids again. She sets Mike up, but changes her mind at the last minute. To rescue her children, she makes a deal with a local underworld figure named Chesney, played by Sebastian Cabot. Chesney double crosses the local Nazi agents while Lisa distracts the chief officer. It&#39;s a satisfactory ending, but one in which Mike is superfluous. By this point the list is all but forgotten, having been supplanted by Lisa&#39;s children as the motivating factor.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot of good here. The film looks great, especially when it&#39;s in Athens. The location photography, and rich use of shadows give it a terrific sense of atmosphere. The cast is solid too. Mitchum is great as a reluctant hero. Stanley Baker is even better as the Gestapo Agent charged with capturing Mitchum. Cap it off with Sebastian Cabot channeling Sidney Greenstreet in the best way possible and this should have been a good movie.</p>
<p>But, in the end, <em>The Angry Hills</em> isn&#39;t really a movie at all.  It starts as a Hitchcockian spy thriller. But before it can get going, it drops that premise and sets up an action picture. And before <em>that</em> can pay off, it tries out a heist picture. Had it followed through on any of these premises, it would likely have turned out better[^1]. Instead we’re given the beginning of one movie, the middle of another, and the end of yet another. Quite a disappointment given the talent involved.</p>
<p>[^1]: Okay, maybe not the wartime action premise. That was just silly.</p>

              <h2>Rachel and the Stranger</h2>
              <p>In <em>Rachel and the Stranger</em>, William Holden plays David Harvey. David is a pioneer farmer living with his young son Davey in the Ohio wilderness. David&#39;s wife Susan died the previous year, sinking him into depression. It&#39;s only after finding Davey using a page from one of his school books as a sail for a toy boat, that David resolves to find a new wife. Not for love, but because he knew how important it was to Susan that Davey not grow up &quot;woodsy&quot;.</p>
<p>David travels to the nearby stockade and consults the Parson. The Parson suggests David buy the contract of a bond woman named Rachael. David likes the idea of a servant. A woman but not a wife.</p>
<p>But the Parson says, &quot;Decent church folk don&#39;t live together, man and woman, under the same roof without marriage.&quot; So David marries Rachael and takes her back to his farm.</p>
<p>Though he is distant, David is not cruel to her. She sleeps in the bed, David sleeps in another room on the floor. Rachael is timid, but works to endear herself. David takes no notice.</p>
<p>Davey, however, is downright cruel. When she tells him she was brought there to give him his schooling and sort of mother him, Davey spits back, &quot;The devil it was! You&#39;re a bond slave is all!&quot;</p>
<p>Things change when Jim, a family friend played by Robert Mitchum, arrives. Jim&#39;s a hunter and tracker. He was a one time suitor of Susan, and both he and David were surprised she chose David over him. Jim, it seems, has decided to settle down, and takes an instant interest in Rachel.</p>
<p>Jim is attentive and charming. David gets jealous. Both men begin to vie for Rachel’s attention, culminating in a fist-fight that leads to Rachel leaving them both. They go after her. There&#39;s an obligatory Indian attack, then it&#39;s over.</p>
<p>The three leads are solid. Young and Holden are convincing, and Mitchum is great as a laconic woodsman. But this is not a good movie. It takes us for simpletons incapable of picking up any subtlety.</p>
<p>Consider when, after arriving in the cabin, Rachael is clearing the table. David and Davey are talking. Davey says he won&#39;t be getting any music lessons. We see Rachael pause. This should have been it. Instead, the film cuts to a drawn-out close-up of Rachael. We see her look off screen, open her mouth to say something, then close it and look down at Davey. Davey looks back, daring her to talk. She doesn&#39;t and walks away. It&#39;s a ten second scene that should have played out in an instant.</p>
<p>The script is clumsy too. Consider the scene where David and Davey are out working. They hear a turkey call. Davey whines abut wanting to go take a shot at the bird. David grabs Davey and dives to the ground. The turkey call is the signal of the Shawnee Indians, he says. Of course, it&#39;s just Jim, but when he steps out of the woods to greet David he tells them there&#39;s signs of Shawnee up to the north. We haven&#39;t heard a thing about Indians up to this point, but now the script mentions Shawnee four times in the span of two minutes. There isn&#39;t a mention of them again until they attack in the finale. This scene, like the Indian attack itself, feels tacked-on and forced.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s how most of this film works. Characters don&#39;t act organically, they act <em>conveniently</em>. Rachael is a reserved mouse until Jim and David get into a fight, then she announces she&#39;s leaving. Rachael has to leave so that David can win her back. Davey spends most of the film spitting venom at Rachael, but after she makes him a meal one night, he&#39;s happy to have her as his mother. Davey has to like her to allow David to fall in love.</p>
<p>And speaking of Davey, he&#39;s an awful character. He&#39;s whiny and obstinate. We&#39;re given no reason to like him. Yes, he misses his mother. But the way he&#39;s presented, one suspects he was annoying long before Susan departed this earth.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a kernel of a good story here, and the three leads are more than capable of pulling it off. But the hackneyed melodramatic fable they&#39;re given to work with is frustrating at best, and annoying at worst. The adult themes of intimacy and emotional neglect belie a trite narrative that&#39;s presented in a condescending manner. Given the talent involved, we deserve better.</p>

              <h2>Locke</h2>
              <p><em>Locke</em> is not a great film, but it is a good one. If you&#39;re on the fence about seeing it, do so. Don&#39;t read any further, as we&#39;re going to talk about plot and this movie works best the less you know going in.</p>
<p>Still here? Okay, here we go.</p>
<p><em>Locke</em> opens with a wide shot of a construction site. It&#39;s dark. Spotlights illuminate a massive foundation hole. Early the next morning, they will pour the concrete. It will be the largest commercial pour in Europe. Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is the construction manager in charge.</p>
<p>Ivan gets into his car. He pulls away from the curb and makes a call. He gets a woman&#39;s voicemail. He tells her he&#39;s gotten her message and that he&#39;s on his way.</p>
<p>As the film unfolds we learn that Ivan is traveling to London from Birmingham. We also learn the circumstances surrounding the trip. Last year he had a one night stand while away on a job. The first and only time he&#39;s strayed in fifteen years of marriage. But the woman, Bethan, became pregnant. Now, the baby has come early and she&#39;s gone into labor.</p>
<p>The rest of the film happens in near real-time, as Ivan juggles a series of calls. We learn more about him. He is both diligent and pragmatic. The kind of man who makes checklists but is able to adapt to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>And so it is with a deliberate logic that he approaches his current situation. He has fathered a child. Now he must do right by it. A deep-rooted psychological need drives him. Ivan&#39;s father abandoned him. Ivan refuses to do the same.</p>
<p>The film doles out this information in small bits as it unfolds. Each nugget raises the emotional stakes and increases the story’s tension. In time, Ivan loses his job, his family and his home. He accepts these events with a calm detachment. These are the consequences of his actions. He compartmentalizes them. He holds to his logic. He must be there for his child. Early on, when Bethan asks if he loves her, Ivan replies &quot;How can I? I don&#39;t know you.&quot; His tone is not cruel. It is the voice of a man trying to convince her of a truth he needs to believe.</p>
<p>Watching Ivan’s world unravel is a compelling journey. Tom Hardy holds our attention from the very first scene. We want to learn more about his character. Through his eyes and inflection, Hardy conveys a character struggling to contain a sea of emotions. Setting the entire film in Ivan’s car doesn’t feel like a stunt, it feels natural. It adds to the claustrophobic sense of desperation that the film cultivates. By the end, we’re hanging on every word.</p>
<p>But about that end. Just as abruptly as it began, the film is over. Ivan&#39;s world has changed and he heads off to what will be, for him, a new life. I didn&#39;t like this ending, but I&#39;m not sure how I would change it. It felt anti-climatic. Not enough to ruin the film, but enough that it left me wanting. But perhaps that&#39;s the point. Just like Ivan, we’re left with an odd sense of detachment.</p>

              <h2>She Couldn't Say No</h2>
              <p>Had it dared to be as provocative as it&#39;s title, <em>She Couldn&#39;t Say No</em> might have been something special. As is, it’s not a bad film, but it is something of a let-down.</p>
<p>The story follows an oil heiress named Korby Lane, played by Jean Simmons. Korby travels to the small town of Progress in rural Arkansas. Once there, she begins anonymously doling out large sums of money to the townsfolk.</p>
<p>She also takes an interest in Doc Sellers, played by Robert Mitchum. Doc susses out Korby&#39;s motivations, and tries to dissuade her. But Korby is stubborn. Her generosity backfires. Flush with cash, the town vet pulls up stakes, leaving the local farmers in a lurch. So does the owner of the boarding house where Korby&#39;s been staying. The town drunk, played by the always charming Arthur Hunnicutt, almost dies of alcohol poisoning.</p>
<p>As the town descends into chaos, Korby realizes the error of her ways. She comes clean as the town&#39;s beneficiary and says there&#39;ll be no more money. Korby and Doc get together and we&#39;re led to believe the town is more-or-less back to normal. Of course, we know that can&#39;t be true, but this is part of how the film lets us down.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a film built on a solid premise with a good cast. But the script has no edge. It plays like a bucolic romantic comedy. Nothing serious happens until the end, when masses of people show up at the general store. They&#39;re all from out of town, hoping to register a local address to get a piece of the pie. The crowd swells. Tempers run short. Someone has a gun. Things start to turn ugly, but Doc arrives in time to settle things down with a hearty speech.</p>
<p>But what if he didn&#39;t? What if the film started as a comedy but then subverted the genre to show the underside of small town life? A biting satire that <em>really</em> explored the effects of sudden wealth on rural America. It might be wrong to criticize the film based on what <em>wasn&#39;t</em> made, but storytelling is about making decisions. And a decision <em>not</em> to do something is still a decision.</p>

              <h2>Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan</h2>
              <p>I was barely a teenager when <em>Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan</em> premiered. Too young to buy a ticket. Not that I wanted to. By that point, slasher films were passé.</p>
<p>And yet, I remember this movie’s release. Word spread fast. Despite the title, Jason didn’t reach New York until the final twenty minutes. They should have called it <em>Jason Takes a Cruise</em>, the joke went, as most of the film took place aboard a boat.</p>
<p>For many fans, this perceived deception was reason enough to skip the film. They didn’t miss much.</p>
<p>The movie opens with a teen couple fooling around on Crystal Lake. After an obligatory resurrection sequence, Jason makes short work of the teens and reclaims his trademark hockey mask[^1].</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the following morning. The local high school’s graduating class sets sail for New York City aboard the Lazarus, an old ocean liner. As they depart, Jason sneaks aboard.</p>
<p>While Jason disappears passengers, we’re presented with a series of subplots involving the students. Our protagonist, Rennie, has visions of a child drowning. The captain’s son, Sean, disappoints his father by fumbling the nautical equivalent of backing the car out of the garage. The prom queen tries to blackmail her biology teacher by seducing him on video.</p>
<p>After thinning the supporting cast, Jason kills the captain. Sean discovers his father’s body and alerts the others. In a refreshing twist, the kids arm themselves and prepare to go on the offensive. But a contrived series of events sinks the ship.</p>
<p>Sean, Rennie, and a few others escape and row to New York City. Jason is, of course, right behind them.</p>
<p>The finale sees Rennie and Sean fleeing Jason through a sewer tunnel due to be flushed with toxic waste.</p>
<p>This isn’t a good movie, but it’s better than its predecessor, <em>Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988)</em>. Although the script saddles its protagonist with an overwrought subplot, it finds time to pepper the supporting cast with personality and even offers some chuckles. Granted, <em>Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)</em> had a more memorable cast, and <em>Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)</em> had wittier humor, but I can appreciate the effort.</p>
<p>And yes, Jason spends more time prowling the Lazarus’s corridors than Manhattan’s streets, but so what? After seven films set at Camp Crystal Lake (or a reasonable facsimile), isn’t any scenery change welcome?</p>
<p>The film’s biggest disappointment isn’t Jason’s meandering journey to New York, it’s that, once he’s there, he gets tunnel vision. He walks through swaths of pedestrians and ignores them. Aside from some street punks, he’s only interested in the Lazarus survivors.</p>
<p>Jason should be a one-man apocalypse, killing anyone within reach. Why else transplant him to the country’s most populous city?</p>
<p>To that end, <em>Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan</em> is more disappointing than awful. Aside from a change of scenery, it offers little we haven’t seen done better before.</p>
<p>[^1]: It even includes the axe-crack from <em>Friday the 13th Part III (1982)</em>. What an amazing coincidence.</p>

            </li>
 <li value=17>
              <h2>Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood</h2>
              <p>There’s a lesson here.</p>
<p>I came to <em>Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood</em> with an open mind. Sure, I’d heard rumblings it was bad, but the masses can be wrong.</p>
<p>The story opens with seven-year-old Tina standing outside a house on Crystal Lake. Inside, we hear her parents fighting. Mom’s yelling at Dad, saying he promised he wouldn’t drink so much. Dad’s smacking Mom and telling her to shut up. It aims for drama but plays as caricature.</p>
<p>Tina runs down to the lake, walks down a short pier, and gets into a small fishing boat. She motors out to the middle of the lake.</p>
<p>Dad comes running out of the house[^1]. He yells for her to come back. Mom comes out and joins in the yelling. Dad advances down the pier.</p>
<p>Tina gives Dad the stink-eye of death and the pier starts shaking. Not a rumble, but a full-on cartoonish wobble. With the pylons jutting several feet into the air, it resembles a carnival ride gone haywire.</p>
<p>The pier crumbles into the lake, taking Dad with it.</p>
<p>We flash-forward to a seventeen-year-old[^2] Tina returning to Crystal Lake along with her mother. Her smarmy psychiatrist, Dr. Crews, insists Tina confront her father’s death by revisiting the scene.</p>
<p>Tina and her mother arrive at the lake house. They find Dr. Crews waiting.</p>
<p>Next door is an obligatory house full of teens.</p>
<p>A few needless scenes later, Tina’s telekinesis reanimates Jason[^3], who sets to work massacring the teens[^4].
Meanwhile, Tina’s mom uncovers Dr. Crews’ true intentions.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of over-emoting and dues ex machina that culminates in Tina hurling flower pots at Jason with her mind.</p>
<p>Okay, so the masses were right. Sitting through this was a chore. Like the song says: <em>Sometimes, bad is bad</em>. Lesson learned.</p>
<p>It should have been better. The script borrows its setup from the franchise’s best entry, <em>Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)</em>. And Kane Hodder brings a hulking physicality to his performance as Jason.</p>
<p>But the film tacks on a mill stone subplot involving telekinetic Tina, her mother, and Dr. Crews that sinks the movie. More than once, I ached to fast-forward through these scenes. They aren’t just bad. They’re screaming baby on an airplane bad. Painful for everyone involved.</p>
<p>I don’t fault the performers; the script does them no favors. Consider Tina. She’s an ineffectual protagonist who spends most of the film in histrionics. The worst kind of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_girl">final girl</a>. When the other teens take an instant dislike to her, we’re on their side. And speaking of those teens, they’re just fodder. None of them register as individuals and they have no chemistry together.</p>
<p>Worst of all, the film takes itself far too seriously. The black humor of <em>Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)</em> is gone. So is the manic campiness of <em>Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985)</em>. Instead, we suffer through scenes alternating between idle boredom and overwrought melodrama.</p>
<p>When Jason offs a character, it’s a relief. Not because it breaks some nonexistent tension, but because we’re one step closer to the film’s end. In <em>Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood</em>, it’s the audience, not Jason’s quarry, that suffers.</p>

<p>[^2]: Setting this entry in the then-future of 2001. I wonder how many fans realized this back in 1988.</p>
<p>[^3]: Jason ended the prior film chained to the bottom of Crystal Lake. The script doesn’t try to explain how Tina’s telekinesis revives him. In his <a href="http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2009/01/friday-13th-part-vii-new-blood.html">review on Horror Movie A Day</a>, Brian Collins speculates the telekinesis aspect was a response to the higher grossing A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise.</p>
<p>[^4]: The movie should end here. Tina resurrects Jason and passes out. Jason dismembers her unconscious body. But no. Jason marches past her <em>and</em> both houses. He goes a few miles up a dark road to off a pair of teens before circling back to continue his rampage.</p>

              <h2>Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives</h2>
              <p>Jason lives. Not <em>Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives</em>, but <em>Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI</em>. After the disappointing grosses of <em>Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985)</em>, Paramount wasn’t taking any chances.</p>
<p>This entry more-or-less ignores the prior film’s events. It opens with Tommy Jarvis determined to rid himself of the specter of Jason. En route to Crystal Lake, he plans to dig up Jason’s corpse and incinerate it. He’s even brought a buddy along for help[^1].</p>
<p>Tommy and his friend dig up the corpse all right, but a lightening strike reanimates the maggot-filled carcass. Undead Jason makes short work of Tommy’s pal but Tommy escapes to warn the local sheriff. Of course, the sheriff doesn’t believe Tommy and runs him out of town.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jason resumes his murderous ways. He offs some corporate paintballers and a few teen camp counselors before Tommy gets back to town. Thinking Tommy committed the murders, the sheriff puts Tommy behind bars.</p>
<p>Not to worry though, the sheriff’s plucky teen daughter soon frees Tommy from his cell. Then, using a plan Tommy gleaned from reading a book on the occult, the two head to Camp Crystal Lake to confront Jason.</p>
<p>This entry cements Jason’s transition from deranged madman to supernatural monster. Jason now has super human strength. Bullets can’t kill him. Early on, Tommy looks to incinerate Jason, but the skies open and the resulting rain prevents Tommy from striking a match. It’s a nice nod that casts Jason as something of a force of nature.</p>
<p>This installment also sports a nice streak of self-referential black comedy. As Jason stalks a group of children, one boy asks another in a deadpan tone: “So, what did you want to be when you grew up?”</p>
<p>Indeed, when Jason’s on-screen this entry’s a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the plot revolves around Tommy.</p>
<p>A better script would have killed him off during the opening sequence. Instead, we suffer through a tired “boy who cried wolf” plot that never pays off, while cringing at the stilted melodrama with the sheriff’s daughter. A stronger performer could have risen above the material. But Thom Mathews’ wooden performance as Tommy kept reminding me of Michael Dudikoff in <em>American Ninja (1985)</em>. Minus the ninja bad-assery.</p>
<p>The focus on Tommy handicaps the supporting cast. Most of Jason’s victims are forgettable. The female camp counselors, in particular, feel like interchangeable fodder.</p>
<p>This isn’t an awful movie, but the forced melodrama and bland supporting cast drag things down. Whenever Jason’s off-screen, <em>Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI</em> is a snooze.</p>

              <h2>Friday the 13th: A New Beginning</h2>
              <p>After <em>Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)</em> delivered the series’s highest grosses, Paramount made an odd decision. They ditched Jason and tried to reboot the franchise.</p>
<p><em>Friday the 13th: The New Beginning</em> follows Tommy, the boy we last saw hacking Jason apart with a machete. He’s seventeen now, having spent the previous six years in a state mental institution. This rare bit of plausibility sets the film in 1990, give or take a year.</p>
<p>Despite being the nominal lead, Tommy&#39;s superficial to the plot and says under two-dozen words throughout the film. His scenes consist of him either looking confused or erupting in sudden violent outbursts.</p>
<p>The setting is, of course, a remote camp. This time, a halfway house for troubled teens meant to ease their re-entry into society.</p>
<p>The plot kicks into gear after one teen murders another with an axe then disappears into the surrounding woods. Following that, an unseen assailant begins murdering teens, staff, and pretty-much everyone else.</p>
<p>Harkening back to the original <em>Friday the 13th (1980)</em>, this entry withholds the killer’s identity until the finale. We’re offered several red-herrings, making this film more mystery-thriller than monster movie.</p>
<p>But the execution is sloppy. The script introduces characters then kills them in the same scene. Several performances veer well into camp. One character even dies trapped in a graffiti-covered outhouse after eating some spicy enchiladas.</p>
<p>Worse still, the killer’s eventual reveal elicits groans instead of gasps. The script offers an explanation via some awkward exposition, but it’s unsatisfying.</p>
<p>But time has been kind. Knowing the franchise rights itself, fans can laugh at the nonsense plot, Tommy’s non-dialog, and the hammy performances. I cannot recommend <em>Friday the 13th: A New Beginning</em>, yet I can&#39;t wholly condemn it either. Like any comically bad movie, it&#39;s best viewed with a crowd that knows what to expect.</p>
<p>That said, it’s no surprise Paramount brought Jason back for the sequel, <em>Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)</em>.</p>

              <h2>Horror of Dracula</h2>
              <p>Howard Hawks once said that a good movie consisted of “three great scenes and no bad ones.” Hammer’s first entry in its <em>Dracula</em> franchise gives us exactly that.</p>
<p>The first great scene comes early. Jonathan Harker has arrived at Castle Dracula posing as a librarian. While prowling the castle’s corridors at night, he finds a young woman. She sports full lips, brilliant blue eyes and ample cleavage. She is terrified. She claims she’s being held prisoner and begs Harker to help her escape. Harker feigns ignorance. She persists. His resolve weakens. He agrees to help her. Grateful, she bursts into tears and buries her head in his shoulder. The music shifts. Her eyes fix on Harker’s neck. Her head tilts back as her eyes close. Her glistening lips draw back to reveal fangs. She bites Harker.</p>
<p>Just as she does, Dracula (Christopher Lee) explodes into the room with a piercing shriek. Lee is feral and demonic. The camera zooms in. Lee’s bloodshot eyes pin us to our seats. His gore-smeared mouth twists into a snarl revealing blood-covered fangs. The shot lasts all of a few seconds, but it still packs a punch. This is Dracula in all his visceral glory.</p>
<p>The second great scene happens at about the three-quarters mark. It’s night and Arthur Holmwood (Michael Gough) has gone to the crypt of his recently deceased sister Lucy to assure himself that she is not a vampire. To Arthur’s horror, he finds Lucy seemingly alive, returning to her tomb, leading a young girl. Lucy sees him. Her eyes light up with more than just brotherly love. “Come, let me kiss you,” she says to Arthur. She advances, baring her fangs. Arthur stands helpless, transfixed by her gaze.</p>
<p>Before she can consummate the act, Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) bursts onto the scene, thrusting a crucifix into Lucy’s face. She backs away in agony. Van Helsing, jaw set, eyes full of cold detachment, advances. Lucy’s cornered. Van Helsing presses the crucifix to her forehead. The flesh smolders and burns, leaving the imprint of the cross. Van Helsing stares down, unmoved. Lucy shrieks and flees into her tomb.</p>
<p>It’s a crackerjack scene that works just as well today as it did half a century ago. The practical effects still look great and Cushing’s performance in the scene is perfect.</p>
<p>The third great scene is the finale. Arthur and Van Helsing have chased Dracula back to his castle. Dawn is fast approaching. Van Helsing catches the Count before he can disappear down a secret passage. The two grapple. Dracula looks to have the upper hand. In a flash of inspiration, Van Helsing vaults atop a long table, runs the length, and launches himself toward the wall. He hits the wall high and pulls down the tapestry curtains, letting in the morning sun. Dracula tries to flee, but Van Helsing fashions a make-shift crucifix out of candle holders to pin him in place.</p>
<p>These swashbuckling acrobatics cement Van Helsing as the heroic foil to the villainous Dracula. Cushing’s Van Helsing isn’t just a wise man with a strong will, he’s a man of action. The iconic monster hunter out to rid the world of supernatural evil.</p>
<p>I vacillate between this film and <em>Dracula (1931)</em> for my favorite interpretation of the Count. I prefer Lee’s grittier performance, but dislike the overt physicality. His Dracula runs, grapples, and digs holes[^1]. It makes for more action on screen, but also lends the character a vulnerability that softens his edge. Also, Lee doesn’t have any dialog apart from his introductory scene, which is a shame. A battle of wills between Cushing and Lee would have been dynamite[^2]. Imagine Lee, with his ominous baritone, delivering the classic line, “For one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you’re a wise man, Van Helsing.”</p>
<p>But these are minor quibbles. Buoyed by iconic performances from Cushing and Lee, <em>Horror of Dracula</em> is a great film. It rolls along at a terrific pace. By paring down the supporting cast and playing up the sex and gore, it makes the familiar plot feel fresh and new. It turns a gothic horror story into a thrilling adventure. Howard Hawks’ definition of a good movie may be a bit simplistic, but <em>Horror of Dracula</em> is proof that simple can work.</p>
<p>[^1]: The hole-digging scene always throws me. Why wouldn’t he put her in the crypt? And how does he happen to have a shovel handy?</p>
<p>[^2]: Lee and Cushing wouldn’t meet again as Dracula and Van Helsing until the disappointing <em>Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972)</em>. Cushing starred in the immediate sequel <em>The Brides of Dracula (1960)</em> which lacked Lee. Lee returned in the third installment <em>Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)</em> which lacked Cushing.</p>

              <h2>Interstellar</h2>
              <p>I know where <em>Interstellar</em> went wrong. I knew the instant it happened. I may have uttered a small groan. But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>It’s three or four generations into the future. Earth is drying up. Giant dust storms ravage the planet. Blight has eradicated all the world’s crops, save corn.</p>
<p>Matthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a former test pilot/engineer who, like just about everyone else, must farm to survive. He hates it, but does it to support his two young children.</p>
<p>A series of gravitational anomalies lead him to the remnants of NASA. NASA has a plan to save humanity. They’ve discovered a wormhole near Saturn leading to potentially hospitable worlds. They’ve got a ship and crew ready. They just need a pilot.</p>
<p>Cooper agrees, even though the journey’s length means he’ll miss years of his children’s lives. If he makes it back at all.</p>
<p>The flight goes smoothly and the crew pass through the wormhole in a sequence that begs favorable comparisons with <em>2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)</em>. On the other side they assess their situation. They count three potential worlds, but the closest and most promising orbits the outskirts of a black hole. This creates a warping effect with time. An hour spent on the planet equates to seven years back on Earth.</p>
<p>They agree to be quick. Cooper pilots a shuttle craft to the planet’s surface. Of course, there are complications. They return just over three hours later, and learn twenty-three years have passed on Earth. Cooper checks his video mail. He sees his son graduate high school, meet a girl, and get married. He sees the birth and death of his grandson. Finally, he sees his son, now a man older than himself, say goodbye, resigned that Cooper is never coming back. Cooper has missed it all. It flattens him and us. Never has a movie conveyed the isolation of space travel like this.</p>
<p>Then Cooper gets a message from his daughter. They had a rough goodbye. She felt Cooper was abandoning her. Now, she’s a full grown woman, the same age as him. But she hasn’t forgiven his leaving.</p>
<p>And this brings us to the point I mentioned earlier. The point where <em>Interstellar</em> loses its way. The film cuts to Cooper’s daughter as she finishes her message. Now we’re back on Earth. No longer alone. Now, we have parallel stories, Cooper in space and Cooper’s family on earth. What started as a meditation on mankind transcending Earth devolves into a predictable melodrama. The special effects are fantastic, and the set pieces are tense and well-executed, but the film lacks anything new to say.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to think <em>Interstellar_’s reach exceeded its grasp. That it tried and failed. I don’t think it tried at all. Rather than explore new themes it settled for familiar dramatic scenarios. Granted, it executes those tropes with masterful precision, but it’s still a letdown. _Interstellar</em> doesn’t transcend the science fiction genre, it abandons it.</p>

              <h2>Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter</h2>
              <p>When <em>Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter</em> premiered I was just a kid, still watching Saturday morning cartoons in my pajamas, my legs dangling off the couch. What I knew of the <em>Friday the 13th</em> films came via third-hand bits of lore relayed in wide-eyed whispers on the playground.</p>
<p>Jason was a hockey mask wearing monster who killed people in awful, horrific ways. I remember, at the video store, seeing the franchise’s iconic box covers. I felt certain those white stencils holding bloody knives or axes were gateways to pure, brutal terror.</p>
<p>Thus, it’s an odd sense of nostalgia that draws me to the series now. Of course, the films aren’t as scary as my young self believed. They’re not scary at all. But watching them takes me back to days of looking for prizes in breakfast cereals. Back when a monster like Jason represented the pinnacle of terror.</p>
<p>This installment picks up where <em>Friday the 13th Part III (1982)</em> ends[^1]. Hanged after suffering a hatchet to the face, Jason is dead. The police cart his body off to the morgue.</p>
<p>But of course, he’s not dead.</p>
<p>Jason wakes up, dispatches some improbably young hospital staff members, then heads back to Crystal Lake to work through a house of oversexed teens.</p>
<p>This script operates on a simple, but proven, formula: titillate then shock[^2]. Show some nudity, then have Jason dispatch someone in a gruesome, over-the-top, fashion. To that end, it delivers.</p>
<p>But it also goes a step further by fleshing out its cast of teen victims. They spend much of the film unaware of Jason or any suspicious goings-on. They’re in their own movie, complete with their own sub-plots. Granted, those sub-plots amount to little more than a bad teen sex comedy, but they hold our interest when Jason’s off-screen[^3].</p>
<p>And when Jason’s on-screen, he’s a juggernaut. An unstoppable, inhuman force of evil. A demon with a machete[^4]. Consider how Jason never runs. Running implies chasing. Chasing suggest the possibility of escape. In this film, Jason isn’t an assailant, he’s an inevitability[^5].</p>
<p><em>Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter</em> is pure, well-executed, exploitation. An amalgam of gratuitous nudity and creative violence. A visceral thrill-ride. It’s not a great movie, but it’s everything my younger self could have hoped for.</p>
<p>[^1]: Films two, three, and four happen back-to-back over four days. This entry starts on Sunday the 15th, and ends on Tuesday the 17th. Yet one character is out to avenge his dead sister, who Jason killed in the second film. Said character has been compiling newspaper clippings on Jason since her death. Except, by the film’s timeline, his sister died less than 48 hours ago. Was he scrapbooking during the funeral?</p>
<p>[^2]: Slasher films aren’t alone in this. One of the best scares in <em>Alien (1979)</em> comes after the camera lingers on some pin-ups of nude women.</p>
<p>[^3]: It also helps that Crispin Glover’s performance foreshadows his turn in <em>Back to the Future (1985)</em>. His dancing scene almost makes the movie.</p>
<p>[^4]: <em>Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)</em> cements this personification by turning him into a kind of Frankenstein’s monster.</p>
<p>[^5]: As a supernatural inevitability, in addition to asphyxiation, Jason would seem immune to the laws of physics. Consider his going from outside the second-floor window to inside the first-floor kitchen in a matter of seconds without making a sound.</p>

              <h2>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1</h2>
              <p>Full disclosure: I haven’t seen the first two <em>Hunger Games</em> films, nor have I read the books.</p>
<p>That said, the film does an admirable job bringing new viewers up to speed. Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has just destroyed the titular Hunger Games, dealing a symbolic blow to the Evil Capitol. Rebel forces have rescued Katniss, but they failed to rescue her true love Peeta, who’s now in the Evil Capitol’s clutches.</p>
<p>In offering a plot summary for this installment however, I am at a loss. Watching it felt like watching the deleted scenes from another film. A better one, where things actually happen.</p>
<p>Here, we see Katniss fret about Peeta, walk through some rubble-strewn towns, and fret about Peeta some more. The threadbare plot culminates in a tepid rescue mission that leaves the characters more-or-less where they started.</p>
<p>In writing, one should omit needless words [^1]. In film, one should omit needless scenes. By this rule, <em>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1</em> should be twenty minutes long instead of two hours.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, every scene should further the plot or enhance characterization. Consider the scenes depicting Katniss’s struggles in filming staged propaganda messages. These scenes setup later scenes where she delivers a stirring call-to-arms once she’s on the ground amidst the dead and wounded. As a whole, they exist to show Katniss’s honesty and empathy. But these are traits we already know she possesses. Cutting these scenes wouldn’t affect the story or diminish the depth of Katniss’s character. They’re redundant.</p>
<p>There’s also a misguided focus on the rebel’s exploitation of Katniss. There are scenes of rebel leaders strategizing. One of the chief aids is, essentially, a publicist. There’s an interesting angle here, but the film paints its factions in such broad strokes it loses any shot at credible political commentary.</p>
<p>A movie doesn’t need explosive action or labyrinthine plot to succeed, but it does need a purpose. This film has none, save to gouge fans for the cost of an extra ticket.</p>
<p>Jennifer Lawrence is a talented actress capable of commanding our attention on screen, but one wouldn’t know it from watching her here. Between the ill-fitting jumpsuit and pale makeup, she looks every bit as listless as the script. Her supporting cast includes Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore. Both avoid rolling their eyes at the dialog, a feat I consider award-worthy.</p>
<p>In the end, <em>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1</em> is a non-movie. Fans of the series should skip straight to the real finale in <em>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)</em>.</p>

              <h2>The Road to Singapore</h2>
              <p><em>The Road to Singapore</em> features a memorable tracking shot. It’s night. Cross-fade from natives pounding jungle drums to a woman gazing out her bedroom window. The camera pulls back and up, away from her window and over acres of dark jungle to settle behind a man standing on his porch, gazing at the woman’s bungalow in the distance.</p>
<p>Granted, the shot’s tracking over an obvious paper-mâché model, but kudos to director Alfred Green for trying. This is a movie whose reach exceeds its grasp.</p>
<p>The man in the shot is Hugh, played by William Powell. The woman is Phillipa, played by Doris Kenyon.</p>
<p>The film opens with them en route to Khota, a small tropical island in the Pacific. Hugh has returned alone after supposedly running off with another man’s wife. Phillipa has come to marry the local doctor, a man she hardly knows. Hugh pursues Phillipa, but she rebukes his advances.</p>
<p>After they arrive in Khota, Phillipa gets married. The marriage goes south fast. She wants him to sweep her off her feet, he wants her to find his socks.</p>
<p>Hugh and Phillipa flirt. Her resolve weakens. Things come to a head when Phillipa, believing her husband to be out of town, accepts Hugh’s invitation to dine at his bungalow.</p>
<p>The film tries for passionate drama but falls short. Too many characters deliver their lines while staring off at nothing in particular. At least the pre-code script delivers a satisfying, and plausible, ending.</p>
<p>What makes <em>The Road to Singapore</em> worth watching is William Powell’s performance. Despite the tropical locale, Powell exudes the urbane wit and charm that would become his trademark. He ambles through the film, impervious to the mediocre melodrama. Powell doesn’t so much carry the movie as rise above it.</p>

              <h2>British Intelligence</h2>
              <p>Fair warning, I’m going to spoil the entire plot of <em>British Intelligence</em>. How else to review it? Plot is all it offers.</p>
<p>It’s World War I and the British are hurting. Every plan they make leaks to the Germans. The British suspect the famed German spy Strendler has infiltrated their organization, but no one can identify him. Desperate to weed out Strendler, the British plan to recall their best agent from undercover duty.</p>
<p>This plan also leaks to the Germans. They kill the British agent and shoot down his extraction plane.</p>
<p>The pilot, Frank Bennett, survives. We see him recovering in a hospital. A nurse, Helene von Lorbeer, played by Margaret Lindsay, tends to him. There’s an attraction between the two, but von Lorbeer says she has to leave.</p>
<p>Von Lorbeer turns out to be a German spy. She’s recalled to headquarters, given a commendation and a new assignment. Posing as a refugee, she’s to infiltrate the house of British cabinet minister Arthur Bennett. Arthur is, of course, Frank’s father.</p>
<p>Von Lorbeer quickly ingratiates herself with the Bennett family. Her German contact is the family butler Valdar, played by Boris Karloff. Unbeknownst to von Lorbeer, Valdar is a double-agent, reporting to the head of British Intelligence.</p>
<p>Some sloppy code-passing by von Lorbeer arouses the suspicions of British Intelligence. They set a trap involving a would-be German agent, but Von Lorbeer sees through it, maintaining her cover.</p>
<p>The return of Frank Bennett prompts von Lorbeer to reveal that she’s actually a British agent. Valdar overhears this and forces von Lorbeer into the cellar at gunpoint. Von Lorbeer claims she invented the British agent story to allay Frank’s suspicions. Valdar doesn’t believe her, but relents after seeing her German commendation. He admits that he is Strendler. Further, the British cabinet are meeting upstairs and he’s planted a bomb to level the house under the guise of a Zeppelin bombing. He’s even stolen plans for the next British offensive.</p>
<p>But the authorities had suspected Valdar and kept him under surveillance. They rush into the cellar and disarm the bomb but Valdar flees with the plans. He’s shot during his escape but makes it to a German safe house. Just as German agents prepare to transmit the British plans, a Zeppelin bomb levels the building.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of plot. The labyrinthine twists of agents, double agents, and triple agents, leave little room for characterization. But maybe that’s by design. Characterization requires a degree of plausibility, and <em>British Intelligence</em> has none.</p>
<p>Take Valdar’s big reveal that he is Strendler. If Valdar was a British agent, he would have told the British about von Lorbeer, making the ruse involving the fake German agent unnecessary. But, if Valdar didn’t tell the British about von Lorbeer, how did they know her handler’s code phrases? Surely, they wouldn’t be reused between agents. And just how did Valdar acquire so much guarded information? His espionage consists of little-more than standing outside thin doors or open windows. As a butler, he wouldn’t be privy to anything discussed at a secure location.</p>
<p>Worse still, even at only an hour and six minutes, <em>British Intelligence</em> is too long. The lengthy opening sequence only serves to introduce Frank Bennett, who disappears for much of the film, only to surface a few minutes before the end. Why not start with von Lorbeer undercover? She’d be a sympathetic character until her reveal as a German spy, which would have been a good one.</p>
<p><em>British Intelligence</em> may be overlong and beset with plot holes, but at least it’s got Karloff. His performance in what amounts to a triple role is the film’s lone bright spot. And it’s nice seeing him work outside the horror genre, even if the resulting picture is underwhelming.</p>

              <h2>For the Defense</h2>
              <p><em>For the Defense</em> stars William Powell as Bill Foster. Bill is a slick defense lawyer famous for using any technicality or loophole to get his clients an acquittal, despite their obvious guilt. He’s so well-respected in the underworld that, when his car’s stolen, the crooks return it after getting a look at the registration.</p>
<p>Bill’s seeing a showgirl, Irene, played by Kay Francis. Irene wants Bill to marry her, but Bill says he’s not the marrying kind. Irene’s also seeing another guy, Jack, behind Bill’s back. Jack’s a nice-enough guy, but he lacks Bill’s swagger. Jack wants to marry Irene, but Irene just strings him along, hoping Bill will change his mind.</p>
<p>Early one morning, Irene’s driving Jack home. They’ve been out all night and Jack’s pie-eyed drunk. Jack gropes at her, causing her to hit and kill a stranded motorist. Recognizing what being discovered with him at the early hour would do to Irene’s reputation, Jack insists she flee the scene. Jack stays and takes the rap for the death alone.</p>
<p>Irene persuades Bill to take Jack’s case. She doesn’t tell Bill she was there. Things look bad for Jack. As the evidence comes to light, Bill realizes Irene’s involvement. Soon, Bill must chose between Irene’s reputation and Jack’s liberty. Irene wants to take the stand to exonerate Jack, but Bill won’t let her. There’s another option, but it means crossing a line Bill vowed he would never cross.</p>
<p>As melodramas go, <em>For the Defense</em> isn’t a bad one. Early on, when Bill’s riding high, his urbane charm, affinity for alcohol[^1], and underworld connections foreshadow Powell’s famous turn as Nick Charles in the <em>Thin Man</em> series of films. Francis plays well opposite him and doesn’t overact her part.</p>
<p>But the film sees both of them delivering lines and, mid-sentence, turning to gaze at nothing in particular for dramatic effect. It’s an annoying affectation that mars an otherwise passable hour and five minutes.</p>

              <h2>A Walk Among the Tombstones</h2>
              <p><em>A Walk Among the Tombstones</em> is a frustratingly inept piece of storytelling.</p>
<p>Liam Neeson stars as Matthew Scudder, a recovering alcoholic and ex-cop. Scudder quit the force after gunning down some street toughs robbing his neighborhood bar. His superiors begged him to stay, calling him a hero and giving him a commendation. Scudder quit anyway. He quit drinking too. Later, we learn his actions weren’t quite so heroic.</p>
<p>Scudder makes his living as an unlicensed private investigator. He goes to work for a drug trafficker who’s wife was kidnapped, raped, tortured, and killed. The trail leads Scudder to a pair of horrific sociopaths.</p>
<p>Scudder works the case as the killers stalk their next target. A better film would focus on the creepy killers, but this script doubles down on cop movie tropes.</p>
<p>Scudder acquires a sidekick in the form of a plucky, street-smart homeless boy named TJ. TJ has sickle-cell anemia; a plot point designed to engender audience sympathy and facilitate an improbable third act. Will TJ break through Scudder’s tough exterior? I think you know the answer.</p>
<p>The film’s contempt for its audience’s intelligence is galling. Scudder verbalizes every clue, even when it makes no sense for him to do so. At one point, Scudder discovers some badly written romance fiction. He reads it aloud even though he’s alone and the camera is on the page.</p>
<p>Spoon-feeding plot-points like this causes the film to drag. Consider the opening sequence. Scudder sits in a car with his partner, who&#39;s bemoaning Scudder&#39;s drinking, saying he worries he can&#39;t count on Scudder to have his back. Scudder gets out of the car and walks into a bar. It&#39;s morning. He grabs a paper and sits down. Without a word, the bartender brings Scudder a coffee and two shots of whiskey.</p>
<p>Why not open with Scudder entering the bar? The morning light and wordless exchange tell us everything. And the partner? We never see him again.</p>
<p>Wikipedia tells me the film combines several Lawrence Block novels. Maybe the script condensed too many subplots into a single movie, or maybe the books were just bad. Either way, it’s pretty damning that Liam Neeson’s would-be New York accent is the least of this film’s problems.</p>

              <h2>Blue Ruin</h2>
              <p><em>Blue Ruin</em> is a taunt thriller that eschews car chases, explosions, and shootouts. How refreshing.</p>
<p>Macon Blair stars as Dwight, a drifter living in a rusted car on the Delaware coast. When he learns his parents&#39; murderer is receiving an early parole, he returns to his small Virginia hometown to exact revenge.</p>
<p><em>Blue Ruin</em> doesn&#39;t settle for revenge movie tropes. Dwight isn&#39;t confident and driven. He&#39;s desperate and scared. He exacts his revenge in a clumsy and brutal bit of violence that leaves him bloody and shaken. His escape proves equally sloppy, leaving him to await the inevitable retaliation.</p>
<p>Roger Ebert was fond of saying, &quot;It&#39;s not what the movie is about, but how it is about it,&quot; and that&#39;s true of <em>Blue Ruin</em>. It&#39;s a simple story, but I loved its straightforward, character-driven, approach. We meet Dwight as he&#39;s easing into a warm bath inside a cozy single family home. Just as he gets comfortable, the owners arrive and Dwight flees. It&#39;s a terrific introduction that draws us into his story. As Dwight&#39;s retribution spirals out of control, we grow concerned for him, investing us in the finale.</p>
<p>Blair is perfect in the role. He never tells us how Dwight is feeling, but his eyes speak volumes. As Dwight watches his parents&#39; killer leave prison, Blair&#39;s expression mirrors the bile and nausea churning in Dwight&#39;s stomach. Later, after Dwight has taken his revenge, Blair&#39;s darting gaze and vacant eyes communicate Dwight&#39;s shock. It&#39;s an award-worthy performance.</p>
<p>The film has its flaws: a bit of on-the-nose dialog and a suspect backstory, but these are minor quibbles. <em>Blue Ruin</em> is that rarest of thrillers, one that places its characters first.</p>

              <h2>The Boogie Man Will Get You</h2>
              <p>Not even the terrific pairing of Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre can save this mess.</p>
<p>Karloff plays Nathaniel Billings, an eccentric but earnest old professor. Billings spends his days working in the basement laboratory of his crumbling New England tavern home.</p>
<p>Along comes Winnie, a young divorcee who wants to buy Billings&#39; house and turn it into an inn. Billings agrees to sell, provided he can stay on and complete his experiments.</p>
<p>Of course, Winnie doesn&#39;t know Billings is trying to engineer an army of atomic supermen to aid the war effort. Or that his test subjects comprise the assorted traveling salesmen that chance upon his door. Or that his experiments have all been fatal failures, leaving him with a room full of well-preserved corpses.</p>
<p>One would expect this sort of thing to come to light during the walk-through, but the script gives Winnie the mental acuity of a toddler.</p>
<p>Lorre plays Arthur Lorencz, a smarmy opportunist who&#39;s the town doctor. He&#39;s also the mayor, mortician, notary, and everything else. He even holds the mortgage on Billings&#39; home.</p>
<p>When Lorencz, as town sheriff, discovers one of the corpses, he confronts Billings. With idyllic pride, Billings explains his experiments. Lorencz sees dollar signs. Never mind the dead body, Billings&#39; experiments could net a fortune! Soon they&#39;re partners bemoaning the lack of quality “test subjects”. It&#39;s a terrific bit.</p>
<p>But rather than continue with this low-key, edgy material, the script degenerates into outright farce. The finale sees the cast held hostage by an escaped fascist seeking to blow up a nearby munitions depot. Because, of course, it makes perfect sense to open an inn next to a munitions depot. Karloff and Lorre do their best, but <em>The Boogie Man Will Get You</em> wastes their potential.</p>

              <h2>Black Legion</h2>
              <p>You’ve never seen Humphrey Bogart like this.</p>
<p>He plays Frank Taylor, a senior machinist and family man who loses an expected promotion to a younger co-worker from an immigrant family. Feeling angry and cheated, Frank falls in with the titular Legion, a black-robed hate group.</p>
<p>The Legion run Frank’s co-worker out of town and Frank ascends to foreman. Things are great until Frank&#39;s Legion-mandated recruiting sees him demoted in favor of his neighbor. Again, the Legion intervenes.</p>
<p>The secrecy and violence wear on Frank. He drinks to excess. His family leaves him. He takes up with a local floozy.</p>
<p>One night, drunk and despondent, Frank confesses everything to his longtime friend Ed. After sobering up, Frank panics and informs the Legion. The Legion kidnap Ed, but things don&#39;t go as planned, leaving Frank with blood on his hands and nowhere to turn.</p>
<p>Early in his career, most of Bogart’s roles were hard-nosed gangsters. Later, he would personify the tough loner. Here, Bogart plays a weak man with a wife and young child.</p>
<p>Rather than a one-dimensional racist, Bogart portrays Frank as a weak-willed man driven by a sense of entitlement. Bogart’s fearless performance doesn’t generate any sympathy for Frank, but it does engender pity.</p>
<p>The script’s biting look at the Legion&#39;s recruiting scheme helps. We’re shown how radio demagogues cultivate resentment and fear, driving Legion membership. New members buy mandatory uniforms and revolvers, fattening the wallets of a small group of profiteers who, in turn, fund the demagogues. This exposé gives the film a docudrama feel.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t swallow Frank&#39;s abrupt transformation from honest family man to drunken womanizer. It feels disingenuous. Racism and hate don&#39;t hit you like a freight train, they eat at you like a cancer. That&#39;s what makes them so insidious. Making things so obvious diminishes Bogart’s performance and undermines the film’s still-relevant social context.</p>
