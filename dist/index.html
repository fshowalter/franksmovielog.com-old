              <h2>Possession</h2>
              <p>I&#39;ve seen <em>Possession</em> twice and I still don&#39;t know what it&#39;s about.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not true. It&#39;s about the bitter dissolution of a marriage. There are… <em>other</em> details, but we&#39;ll get to them later.</p>
<p>First, I shall attempt to convey a sense of the viewing experience. If you&#39;ve seen the film, I can hear you laughing.</p>
<p>The opening sequences assault you. Mark, played by Sam Neill, returns home to West Berlin and discovers his wife Anna, played by Isabelle Adjani, has checked out of their marriage. Neill and Adjani over-emote in performances ripped from a daytime soap opera. And yet, their scenes with their kindergarten-age son, Bob, feel restrained and true. The contrast holds your interest, as does the mystery of Mark&#39;s job. The indirect way he talks to his employers and their responses hint at clandestine—even sinister—origins.</p>
<p>As the film marches on, the stakes rise. Mark moves out and spirals into an obsessive mania. When he visits some days later, Mark finds Bob alone and neglected. He moves back in and Anna disappears. In search of Anna, Mark confronts her new lover, gets bloodied, and returns home. There he discovers Anna, who won&#39;t divulge where she&#39;s been. Frustrated, Mark beats her.</p>
<p>So far, I&#39;ve been cagey with the film&#39;s plot points. What follows crosses into spoiler territory. Director Andrzej Żuławski&#39;s film is a nihilistic Gordian knot of symbolism presented as psychological horror. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not sure what the film is about; I&#39;m not sure how the film is about it.</p>
<p>Anna has been disappearing to a derelict apartment where she copulates with a squid-like tentacled monster. This… <em>thing</em> exhibits powerful psychic abilities, possessing the mind of anyone around it.</p>
<p>The monster requires human flesh (or blood?) to grow, leading Anna to murder a series of interlopers, including her former lover, and a detective hired by Mark.</p>
<p>Once the bodies pile up, the film catches up to Neill and Adjani&#39;s performances. Now their manic behavior feels appropriate. It&#39;s a subtle trick I didn&#39;t catch until my second viewing. Watching <em>Possession</em> in a theater, the audience—full of wry snickers early on—sat riveted in silence by this point.</p>
<p>And I haven&#39;t mentioned Anna&#39;s doppelgänger or the scene where Anna—oozing blood and slime from every orifice—miscarries the tentacle monster&#39;s offspring in a deserted subway corridor.</p>
<p>What is Żuławski saying? Between the talk of God and reoccurring shots of the Berlin Wall, <em>Possession</em> remains a mystery. One that sticks with me for days. Is it the mix of nihilism and the supernatural? Perhaps. Regardless, though I may not know why it resonates, I can&#39;t deny that it does.</p>

              <h2>The Sister of Ursula</h2>
              <p>Part soft-core porn. Part giallo. All boring. </p>
<p><em>The Sister of Ursula</em> centers on two sisters, Dagmar and Ursula. As the film opens, they&#39;re checking into a luxury hotel on the Italian coast. Ursula begs Dagmar to leave, claiming visions of a horrible future. With heavy sighs, Dagmar dismisses Ursula&#39;s pleadings. Ursula pouts. Instead of establishing a forbidding atmosphere, the scene left me cold to Ursula&#39;s petulant behavior. </p>
<p>Dagmar convinces Ursula to accompany her to the hotel nightclub. There we meet the supporting players: the hotel manager, a sultry nightclub singer, and a pretty-boy gigolo. Dagmar feels a connection to the gigolo, but Ursula insists he&#39;s dangerous. More sighs and dismissals from Dagmar.</p>
<p>As the film goes on, a pattern emerges. The script introduces either a character who has sex with a supporting player or a pair of characters who have sex with each other. A mysterious black-gloved figure watches the copulating couple from the shadows. After some late-night-cable-grade soft-core erotica, the black-gloved figure kills one or both of the lovers. Aside from a slashed throat, the violence occurs off-screen. </p>
<p>The script offers few red herrings. Instead, it doles out assorted subplots including the sisters&#39; search for their estranged mother, the hotel manager&#39;s struggles with his estranged wife, and the gigolo&#39;s drug habit. </p>
<p>None of these threads held my interest. But the film&#39;s reputation as a sleazy giallo had me certain it would veer into crazy territory. </p>
<p>It proved a long wait. During the finale, after an unsurprising reveal of the killer&#39;s identity, we see the murder weapon. Spoiler—it&#39;s a giant phallus. Seeing the killer advance, phallus in hand, was just the sort of crazy I&#39;d been expecting. But this scene doesn&#39;t justify the hour-and-a-half investment. I&#39;ve said it before, but it bears repeating. I can forgive a movie many things. Bad acting? Specious plotting? Gratuitous nudity? I can overlook them all. But I can&#39;t forgive boring.</p>

              <h2>Rio Bravo</h2>
              <p><em>Rio Bravo</em> is my favorite movie but I can&#39;t imagine how to review it. </p>
<p>This marks my 101st review since relaunching this site in 2014. Prior to that, I strove to review every film I saw. Keeping pace with my movie-watching habit meant cranking out reviews at a relentless pace. </p>
<p>With the relaunch, I focused on quality over quantity. A good review describes the film and the experience watching it. As Roger Ebert said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, if it is a Pauly Shore comedy, there are people who like them, and they should be able to discover in your review if the new one is down to their usual standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s the goal. A cursory look through my last 100 reviews reveals ample failures. Good writers show rather than tell. Too often, I present my opinion as fact instead of building a case for the reader to arrive at the same conclusion. </p>
<p>Consider this line, from my review of <em>Maléfique (2002)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Carrère, Gérald Laroche provides a grounded audience surrogate whose gradual transformation into a bitter convict carries the film.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does that mean? How does it carry the film?</p>
<p>Or this bit, from my review of <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s (1961)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patricia Neal plays the rich, married woman who pays Paul&#39;s rent and keeps him in nice clothes. She makes an impression by underplaying her role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does she underplay the role?</p>
<p>Or from my review of <em>Giallo a Venezia (1979)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The murders—particularly the prostitute&#39;s—are uninspired and ugly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What makes them uninspired and ugly? I&#39;m not describing the murders, I&#39;m describing my reaction to them, but not calling that out as opinion.</p>
<p>And consider the outright nonsense I&#39;ve written, like the closing line from my review of <em>Interstellar (2014)</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interstellar doesn’t transcend the science fiction genre, it abandons it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lines like that make me wonder if I&#39;m wasting my time. True, practice makes perfect, but practice requires feedback.</p>
<p>Stephen King writes for his wife. My wife provides great feedback but I have to petition her to read my work. She doesn&#39;t like my style. I could take that as feedback in itself, but I&#39;ve read reviews she <em>does</em> enjoy and <em>I</em> don&#39;t like them. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried soliciting feedback via comments. The few replies I received spoke to my opinions, not the writing itself. Fair enough, considering the site&#39;s homepage receives little traffic compared to the individual reviews. </p>
<p>It&#39;s time I admit it: Constant Reader, you don&#39;t exist.</p>
<p>So why bother? </p>
<p>I ask myself that a lot.</p>
<p>The answer is my daughters. Neither is old enough to read, but they&#39;re my audience. At least, their future selves. At my current pace, I&#39;ll have written several hundred reviews by the time they&#39;re old enough to watch R-rated movies. By the time they&#39;re my age, statistics say I&#39;ll be dead. </p>
<p>Which makes my failures as a writer all the more painful. But I still have time. Tomorrow&#39;s rewrite can fix today&#39;s shortfall. Provided I solve the feedback problem. </p>
<p>But back to <em>Rio Bravo</em>.</p>
<p>John Wayne stars as John T. Chance, sheriff of Presidio County, Texas. He&#39;s holding Joe Burdette for murder. Joe&#39;s brother, Nathan, is a wealthy land baron. Nathan recruits a slew of mercenaries to free Joe. Chance&#39;s allies consist of his drunken deputy Dude, played by Dean Martin, a crippled old curmudgeon named Stumpy, played by Walter Brennan, a young gunslinger named Colorado, played by Ricky Nelson, and a showgirl turned gambler named Feathers, played by Angie Dickinson. </p>
<p>The script establishes the premise in the first ten minutes, with almost no dialog. From there, the film unfolds at a languid pace. There are flashes of action, but much of the film sees the cast sitting or standing around indoors, talking or reacting to one-another.</p>
<p>Here is where I falter. I&#39;m not sure why the film works so well. I can point to the charisma of Wayne and Martin, but that&#39;s only part of it. The film speaks to something deeper. A good chunk of the film revolves around Chance rehabilitating Dude. Chance doesn&#39;t coddle him, but it&#39;s not &quot;tough love&quot; either. Chance believes Dude will come around. For Dude, the desire to live up to that faith is stronger than any addiction.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a wonderful male fantasy, and for two hours and change, we believe it. Chance is an idealized big-brother/father figure. He&#39;s the strong, honest, capable, professional man we want to be. Dude is the flawed, vulnerable man we feel we are. Chance&#39;s faith in Dude is Chance&#39;s faith in us. Watching <em>Rio Bravo</em> is a low-key cathartic experience. The most powerful scenes are wordless or book-ended with comic relief. It&#39;s not a heavy film, but it punches above its weight.</p>
<p>And about the comic relief. Much of it comes via Walter Brennan&#39;s character, but repeat viewings have lent a comedic shade to many of Wayne&#39;s lines. Like Billy Wilder&#39;s best films, <em>Rio Bravo</em> uses comedy as a subtle distraction. When Chance says, &quot;Sorry don&#39;t get it done Dude,&quot; we smirk at the delivery but feel the message.</p>
<p>I&#39;m closing in on a thousand words and I haven&#39;t touched on Angie Dickinson&#39;s performance or Dimitri Tiomkin&#39;s score. I could devote a couple hundred words to each and not do them justice.</p>
<p>Indeed, one could write a book analyzing the film but I suspect only the author would enjoy it. <em>Rio Bravo</em> taps into emotions it never acknowledges. We interpret the undercurrents based on our own experiences. Over-explaining things would force a singular interpretation and alienate the reader. </p>
<p>Or maybe I&#39;m trying to justify my shortcomings as a writer. </p>
<p>You tell me.</p>

              <h2>My Bloody Valentine</h2>
              <p><em>My Bloody Valentine</em> proves you can defy the tropes while still staying true to the genre.</p>
<p>The plot is vintage 80&#39;s slasher. Years earlier, a small Nova Scotian mining town saw a cave-in trap several miners. The men on watch were AWOL at a Valentine&#39;s Day party, forcing the lone survivor to resort to cannibalism. Following his rescue, the survivor donned his mining gear and murdered the negligent men. The town hasn&#39;t celebrated Valentine&#39;s Day since.</p>
<p>Flash-forward. A fresh group of young miners and their girlfriends want to have a Valentine&#39;s Day party. Unbeknownst to them, someone wearing a miner&#39;s outfit has begun offing locals. The mayor and sheriff keep the killings under wraps and cancel the party. The frustrated miners move the party to the mine. Soon, the youngsters find themselves trapped underground with the killer.</p>
<p>Like <em>Friday the 13th (1980)</em>, the story revolves around a tragedy of neglect born of indulgence. In a subtle nod, the film sets Valentine&#39;s Day on a Saturday, making the preceding Friday the 13th. Like <em>Halloween (1978)</em> it features a holiday theme. But <em>My Bloody Valentine</em> eschews wooded cabins or suburban homes and substitutes a dank, dark, coal mine. It&#39;s an inspired choice that works thanks to the location photography. Another inspired choice is the script&#39;s allowance for multiple survivors. By avoiding the &quot;final girl&quot; trope, the film avoids the contrived plotting that goes into whittling a group, despite the natural human impulse to stick together.</p>
<p>Indeed, as an 80&#39;s slasher, the only things working against the film are the Nova Scotian accents. To me, they sound too cheerful and polite, giving the film an unintentional satirical tone.</p>

              <h2>Harry in Your Pocket</h2>
              <p>Every so often, a film works despite not working.</p>
<p>In <em>Harry in Your Pocket</em>, James Coburn plays the titular Harry, a professional pick-pocket. He operates with Casey, an aging crook played by Walter Pidgeon. The plot follows a young couple who join Harry and Casey to form a wire mob.</p>
<p>A wire mob is an organized team of pick-pockets. Though we never learn the mechanics of pick-pocketing, we learn the lingo. A spotter directs stalls to distract the mark for the cannon who passes the poke to the drop.</p>
<p>The gang travels from Seattle up to British Columbia then down to Salt Lake City. They board in the finest hotels and dine in the finest restaurants, their lifestyle financed by Harry via strangers&#39; wallets. I appreciated the elegant way the film presented the bleak truth: what can Harry do with the money but spend it?</p>
<p>To that end, Coburn&#39;s Harry proves an enigma. We learn little about him yet he remains relentlessly interesting.</p>
<p>The trouble is, the film isn&#39;t about Harry, it&#39;s about Ray and Sandy, the young stalls who join Harry&#39;s gang. Thanks to Trish Van Devere&#39;s performance, I could buy Sandy as a detached thrill seeker, but Michael Sarrazin&#39;s performance as Ray left me impatient.</p>
<p>Devoid of any edge, Sarrazin plays Ray as a generic nice guy who&#39;d prefer a 9-to-5 job and a house in the suburbs. When Ray&#39;s alone on screen, the film drags. </p>
<p>Still, I liked the movie. Chalk it up to Coburn. He&#39;s so interesting to watch, he makes mediocre movies good, and good movies great. <em>Harry in Your Pocket</em> is closer to mediocre, but Coburn makes it worthwhile.</p>

              <h2>The Thin Man</h2>
              <p><em>The Thin Man</em> drags at first, but give it a chance. </p>
<p>It opens with eccentric inventor Clyde Wynant preparing to go into seclusion to work on a new project. He&#39;s interrupted by a visit from his daughter Dorothy who announces her engagement. </p>
<p>Wynant hurries Dorothy out but promises to return in time for her wedding. Wynant continues his preparations but finds the $50,000 in bonds he&#39;d earmarked as a wedding present to Dorothy have gone missing. </p>
<p>Wynant storms over to his mistress Julia&#39;s apartment and catches her in another man&#39;s arms. Wynant accuses Julia of stealing the bonds and threatens to turn her over to the police. </p>
<p>Three months later, Dorothy hasn&#39;t heard from her father. While out at a restaurant, she recognizes former detective Nick Charles, played by William Powell, and approaches him for help. Nick declines, citing his new life of leisure with his heiress wife Nora, played by Myrna Loy. </p>
<p>But when circumstances pin a pair of murders on the still missing Wynant, Nick steps in, uncovering a buried skeleton and a labyrinthine array of suspects and motives. The mystery culminates with New York&#39;s finest corralling everyone to a dinner party where Nick reveals the true killer. </p>
<p>The talky opening betrays the film&#39;s B-movie production. It&#39;s a stiff ten minutes but don&#39;t worry. Once Powell makes his appearance—in a posh bar showing an impromptu crowd how various cocktails demand unique shaking rhythms (Manhattans a Fox-Trot, Bronxs a Two-Step, and Dry Martinis a Waltz)—everything changes. The dialog shifts from stilted exposition to witty banter as Powell glides through the film as the witty urbane charmer we believe ourselves to be after a few drinks. </p>
<p>The script offers little real danger and the entire plot proves little more than a MacGuffin to support his lyrical banter, which reaches its apex during the iconic dinner party scene. As Nora says, “It&#39;s the best dinner I&#39;ve ever listened to.”</p>

              <h2>His Private Secretary</h2>
              <p>Foreshadowing a career playing characters with great names, John Wayne plays a wealthy socialite named Dick Wallace.</p>
<p>After chewing him out for being a drunken womanizer, Wallace&#39;s father puts him to work collecting a debt owed by a minister. Wallace falls for the minister&#39;s daughter, Marion, played by top-billed Evelyn Knapp.</p>
<p>The film&#39;s first half sees Wallace pursue Marion. The two marry, which causes a rift between Wallace and his father, who views Marion as a gold digger despite never meeting her.</p>
<p>Marion goes to the elder Wallace to smooth things over, but a mix-up lands her hired as his secretary.</p>
<p>The early scenes with John Wayne as a drunken playboy checking out women&#39;s ankles in his rearview mirror had me laughing. They&#39;re almost enough to recommend the film. But the lack of chemistry between Wayne and Knapp, and the awkward third-act plotting, reserve <em>His Private Secretary</em> for Wayne die-hards only.</p>

            </li>
 <li value=96>
              <h2>Giallo a Venezia</h2>
              <p>I have a soft-spot for over-the-top exploitation films, but not mean-spirited ones. </p>
<p>A few months back, I gave <em>Island of Death (1977)</em> a four-star review, praising its “everything-but-the-kitchen sink approach that pushes the film past any genuine scares or mean-spirited umbrage, and firmly into parody.” <em>Giallo a Venezia</em> opens with a similar vibe. </p>
<p>We meet an improbably coiffed police detective inspecting the murder of a married couple, Fabio and Flavia. </p>
<p>As the case unwinds, we learn Fabio was a sex fiend. In a series of flashbacks, he pushes Flavia to engage in escalating deviant behavior. First simple voyeurism, but soon he&#39;s whipping her, encouraging strangers to grope her, and her to grope strangers. </p>
<p>The whipping bit had me laughing. The scene starts with Fabio and Flavia in bed. She tries to engage him, kissing and fondling him, but he&#39;s bored and soon retires to another room where he thumbs through a book of erotic drawings. Still looking at the drawings, Fabio snorts a sizable amount of cocaine. The combination enacts a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transformation that sees him return to Flavia, cat-o-nine-tails in hand, and wail on her. She screams which only excites him further, and soon he&#39;s forcing himself into an uncomfortable place. Played straight, the scene would be painful, but it&#39;s so over-the-top, it&#39;s hard to take seriously. </p>
<p>But instead of embracing the ridiculous, the film doubles down on misogyny. A mysterious killer offs a prostitute and some friends of Fabio and Flavia. The murders—particularly the prostitute&#39;s—are uninspired and ugly. The film gets progressively meaner, culminating in a gang-rape scene I found hard to watch. <em>Giallo a Venezia</em> isn&#39;t crazy enough to entertain and lacks any thoughts to provoke. It&#39;s just rubbing our noses in a series of obnoxious scenes it believes pass for edgy drama.</p>

            </li>
 <li value=95>
              <h2>The Ghoul</h2>
              <p>Even the most ardent Boris Karloff fan can skip <em>The Ghoul</em>. </p>
<p>It&#39;s a bait and switch. The opening sees Karloff playing an ailing, disfigured Egyptologist. Bedridden in a gloomy mansion, he details the conditions for his entombment following his imminent death. It&#39;s a good setup, and the funeral scene that follows has us pumped for some undead action. </p>
<p>But these scenes appear tacked on to capitalize on Karloff&#39;s prior box office successes: <em>The Mummy (1932)</em> and <em>The Old Dark House (1932)</em>. </p>
<p>Despite the title, <em>The Ghoul</em> isn&#39;t a horror film. With Karloff off-screen, the film devolves into a tedious mystery. A slew of characters turn up searching for a rare jewel stolen from Karloff&#39;s tomb. </p>
<p>With the supporting cast&#39;s flat delivery and stiff dialog, following the convoluted plot proves an ordeal. The overbearing score doesn&#39;t help. </p>
<p>Granted, the cobwebbed sets and shadowy photography create a rich gothic atmosphere, but the film fails to exploit it. When Karloff finally returns for the film&#39;s final third as the titular ghoul, he&#39;s far from terrifying. Creeping around like a dim-witted zombie, he seems as bored as we are.</p>

            </li>

              <h2>Casablanca</h2>
              <p>By the time I watched <em>Casablanca</em>, I already knew every line of dialog.</p>
<p>During my senior year of high school, I worked at Suncoast Video. It wasn&#39;t a rental store, but one that sold VHS and Laserdisc movies.</p>
<p>On monitors mounted throughout the store we&#39;d show whatever clamshelled, family-friendly title corporate was pushing—think <em>Free Willy (1993)</em>. </p>
<p>During the holiday season, corporate would ship washing-machine-sized boxes of product for us to stock. Nothing stayed in the back room so we&#39;d be there—well past midnight—stacking copies of <em>The Bodyguard (1992)</em> and <em>Sister Act (1992)</em>.</p>
<p>While we worked, we&#39;d put on a movie. The monitors would be off, but we&#39;d listen. <em>Casablanca</em> proved an employee favorite on those long nights. Though I&#39;d never seen it, I loved the crackling dialog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca and the Germans have outlawed miracles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story takes place during World War II. Casablanca, an unoccupied French colony, has become a purgatory for European refugees looking to escape to America. We meet Rick, an American expatriate played by Humphrey Bogart. He runs the most popular cafe in town. As Louis, the venal Prefect of Police played by Claude Rains says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everybody comes to Rick&#39;s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Rick&#39;s they&#39;re entertained by Sam, a piano playing singer played by Dooley Wilson. Aside from Sam and the cafe, Rick maintains a cool detachment from everything and everyone. That changes once long-lost flame Ilsa (played by Ingrid Bergman) walks in on the arm of Victor Lazlo, a resistance leader wanted by the Germans.</p>
<p>Seeing Ilsa shakes Rick from his isolationist stance, and soon he&#39;s abetting the local resistance. The Germans retaliate by insisting Louis shut down the cafe. Amid the chaos of the police chasing everyone out, Rick demands an explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LOUIS<br>I&#39;m shocked, SHOCKED, to find gambling going on here!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(A croupier approaches with a large wad of cash)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CROUPIER<br>Your winnings sir.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>LOUIS<br>Oh, thank you, very much!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s not just funny, it&#39;s Billy Wilder funny.</p>
<p>But the film pivots with ease. Grounded in relatable emotions, the melodrama packs a punch. Consider how Rick spits venom at Ilsa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, I guess neither one of our stories is very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Lazlo, or were there others in between or… aren&#39;t you the kind that tells?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No weepy speeches, just relatable emotion setup by an earlier scene between a drunken Rick and Sam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SAM<br>Let&#39;s get outta here.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>RICK<br>No Sam, I&#39;m waiting for a lady.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SAM<br>Please boss, let&#39;s go. Ain&#39;t nothing but trouble for you here.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>RICK (staring at the liquor in front of him)<br>She&#39;s coming back. I know she&#39;s coming back.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SAM<br>We&#39;ll take the car. We&#39;ll drive all night. We&#39;ll get drunk. We&#39;ll go fishing and stay away until she&#39;s gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>RICK (not looking at Sam)<br>Shut up and go home, will ya?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>SAM<br>No sir, I&#39;m staying right here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great lines abound but some of the film&#39;s best moments are visual. I didn&#39;t discover them until years later, when I finally sat down and watched the film. Nice touches like when the waiter checks his pockets after the pickpocket bumps him. Or the beat-perfect editing between Rick and Louis during the finale. </p>
<p>And let&#39;s talk about that ending. It&#39;s not a happy one. Rick sends the love of his life away and goes off to a likely death. Noble? Absolutely. But in an era where studios were allergic to unhappy endings, it&#39;s amazing this one went over.</p>
<p>Further, it&#39;s impressive how the script doesn&#39;t have Ilsa waffle, even when she believes Rick has betrayed Victor. This casts her in an unflattering light, but gives the ending its resonance.</p>
<p>I was a movie buff before <em>Casablanca</em>. It&#39;s what got me the video store job. But <em>Casablanca</em> made me a Bogart fan, which led me to <em>The Big Sleep (1946)</em> and <em>The Maltese Falcon (1941)</em>, which led me to <em>The Thin Man (1934)</em>, along with the films of John Huston and Howard Hawks, which led me to the films of William Powell and John Wayne, which led me to <em>Rio Bravo (1959)</em>, and well… you get the idea. <em>Casablanca</em> changed my life.</p>
<p>And I&#39;m not alone. Roger Ebert considered <em>Casablanca</em> his favorite movie. What higher recommendation can I offer?</p>

              <h2>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</h2>
              <p>Buried under the bad, there&#39;s just enough good to make <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em> a frustrating experience. </p>
<p>The film opens during the final moments of <em>Man of Steel (2013)</em>. We follow Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne rushing through the chaotic streets of Metropolis. </p>
<p>Overhead, Superman battles Zod—a Kryptonian bent on wiping out humanity. The two aliens crash through buildings and unleash arcs of laser-like heat vision. </p>
<p>As Bruce approaches Wayne Enterprises&#39; Metropolis office, Superman and Zod rip through the building like a bullet. The skyscraper topples, sending out a massive cloud of debris. </p>
<p>People scream. </p>
<p>Emergency responders freeze. </p>
<p>Bruce Wayne runs toward the destruction. </p>
<p>As the dust clears, Bruce snatches little girl from the path of some falling debris. He crouches down and looks in her wide eyes. “It&#39;s going to be okay,” he says. “We&#39;re going to find your mom. Where is she? Where&#39;s your mom?” </p>
<p>The girl points—her arm shaking—toward the smoldering rubble of the Wayne tower. Bruce pulls the girl close and glares up—eyes full of rage—at Superman and Zod still zooming through the air. </p>
<p>With that shot, any apprehension I had about Affleck evaporated. He&#39;s not wearing the suit, but he&#39;s Batman. </p>
<p>Consider this sequence&#39;s accomplishments. </p>
<p>It summarizes and even provides the payoff for the excessive destruction sequences of the prior film. </p>
<p>It sells Affleck in the role of Batman. </p>
<p>It establishes motivation for the conflict between the titular characters. </p>
<p>All this with near-constant action and no exposition. It&#39;s an amazing sequence. </p>
<p>But it also commits the film&#39;s most egregious sin: it raises our expectations. </p>
<p>From here, the film devolves into a mess of dead-end plot threads and superfluous characters. </p>
<p>Some had potential. Holly Hunter plays a US Senator chairing a hearing discussing Superman&#39;s unchecked role in global affairs. We&#39;re given an iconic image of Superman hovering outside the Capitol building, before symbolically landing and walking inside. What followed should have been crackling, character-driven drama. Instead, the building blows up. </p>
<p>This explosion comes courtesy of Lex Luthor, played by Jessie Eisenberg as an eccentric young industrialist. He blows up the Capitol because—well, mostly because the script feels stitched together. Luthor manipulates Superman and Batman into fighting one another because—well, see above. Luthor also creates a giant monster because… well, you get the idea. </p>
<p>Other characters and scenes exist solely to set up the next films in the franchise. We meet Wonder Woman. She&#39;s superfluous to the story, but proves a compelling character, largely because she&#39;s devoid of angst. We also get awkward teases for Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. </p>
<p>Indeed, there&#39;s so much going on, I can&#39;t imagine someone following it all without having read the comics. </p>
<p>How else to recognize the small, but important bits of characterization? Like how Joker&#39;s murdering Robin lead to this film&#39;s more brutal Batman. Or bigger bits, like uber-villain Darkseid&#39;s Omega sigil in Bruce&#39;s apocalyptic vision and how Luthor&#39;s ramblings in the finale reference Darkseid&#39;s mother box technology. Reading between the lines, Luthor was little more than Renfield to Darkseid&#39;s Dracula. </p>
<p>But relying on the viewer&#39;s prior exposure to the characters invites preconceived notions of who these characters should be. And I can&#39;t imagine anyone familiar with the Superman mythos getting behind this version of Luthor. </p>
<p>And we haven&#39;t even covered the inanity of a script that sees Batman murder criminals and cause the same wanton destruction that so enraged him during the film&#39;s opening sequence. Consider Batman, in his plane, leading a monster back to the city so he can retrieve a weapon that might kill it. Why not fly back, grab the weapon, then battle the monster in relative isolation? Because the movie isn&#39;t interested in making sense. It&#39;s too busy trying to build a franchise.</p>

              <h2>Play Motel</h2>
              <p>I expected a sleazy giallo and I got a sleazy giallo. The catchy folk-rock theme song? That surprised me.</p>
<p>As of this writing, the film&#39;s IMDb page has no trivia. No proof the American distributor already owned the song, spliced it into the soundtrack, and changed the film&#39;s title. Nope, none at all. So, clearly, director Mario Gariazzo commissioned the theme, believing it a perfect tonal fit. If that&#39;s true, it might merit an extra star.</p>
<p>The film&#39;s plot concerns a blackmail scam photographing wealthy marks in compromising positions in the titular establishment. Said positions feature lots of nudity and kinky behavior.</p>
<p>Soon, a black-gloved killer starts picking off victims peripheral to the scam. After the killer stashes a body in a parked car&#39;s trunk, the car&#39;s owners, a young couple, get involved.</p>
<p>At the local police&#39;s urging, the couple turns amateur sleuths, a questionable decision that sees the wife pose nude for a sleazy photographer while her husband waits in the car. When she&#39;s inevitably captured and beaten, he&#39;s laughably unconcerned.</p>
<p>This all plays out as an over-the-top cross between Scooby-Doo and softcore porn. The end reveal is laugh-out-loud implausible, and the blackmail scenes are as explicit as the censors would allow. It&#39;s pure exploitation in all it&#39;s ridiculous glory and I&#39;ll admit, it kept me entertained. If sleazy giallos are your thing, <em>Play Motel</em> won&#39;t disappoint.</p>

              <h2>Heat</h2>
              <p>I tilt forward in my seat. My heels rise. The balls of my feet press into the floor. My hands clench tight and I realize I&#39;m holding my breath. <em>Heat</em> on the big screen is an experience.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen the film several times, yet the centerpiece shootout scene in the streets of downtown Los Angeles always elicits a visceral reaction.</p>
<p>Boiled down, it&#39;s a cops and robbers story. Robert De Niro leads a crew of professional thieves taking down a series of Los Angeles scores. Al Pacino leads the cops in pursuit. They&#39;re archetypes in the Howard Hawks tradition—professions personified.</p>
<p>Indeed, <em>Heat</em> feels like a Hawks picture, right down to the underwritten female characters. But while Hawks romanticized the professional, <em>Heat</em> shows us the cost of such a lifestyle. De Niro plans the heists with military precision, yet lives alone in a palatial seaside estate that could pass for vacant. Pacino hunts De Niro&#39;s crew with obsessive fervor, even as his third marriage crumbles around him. Both performances feel larger than life yet intensely human.</p>
<p>But back to the shootout. It makes the movie. The scene carries an immense gravitas because everything about it feels authentic. From the way the characters fire short bursts and reload, to their tactical movements, it all resonates.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not to say writer/director Michael Mann values authenticity over drama. His kinetic editing includes plenty of long and wide shots to establish movement and geography, immersing us in the scene. We don&#39;t witness the gunfight we <em>experience</em> it.</p>

              <h2>Free Fire</h2>
              <p>You know that scene in crime movies, where a back-alley deal turns sour, resulting in a shootout? <em>Free Fire</em> stretches that into an entire movie.</p>
<p>Set in 1978 Boston, the plot sees Cillian Murphy and Michael Smiley play IRA gang leaders buying guns from gang leaders played by Sharlto Copley and Armie Hammer. Brie Larson plays the intermediary. As the deal goes down, a grunt in one gang squabbles with a grunt the other gang, escalating into a full-fledged melee. Amid the flying bullets, the script weaves in some double-crosses. But honestly? The details escape me. <em>Free Fire</em> isn’t concerned with plot, but style.</p>
<p>And it’s got style to spare. The clothes, the hair, the set decoration—this movie does the impossible: it makes 1978 look cool. Do they give Academy Awards for that? They should.</p>
<p>But as much as I enjoyed the film’s look, the execution frustrated me. When the firefight breaks out, director Ben Wheatley offers no sense of geography. Folks shoot and scramble for cover but we have no sense of their placement in relation to one another. A few wide shots would have sufficed. Disorient characters, not the audience.</p>
<p>Still, it almost doesn’t matter. The dialog held my ear, and despite little plot or characterization, the cast—particularly Hammer—grabbed my attention through sheer charisma. <em>Free Fire</em> isn’t a good movie, but it’s as good an okay movie as you’ll find.</p>

              <h2>Raw</h2>
              <p>I was fine with the cannibalism, but everything else irked me.</p>
<p><em>Raw</em> stars Garance Marillier as Justine, a young woman entering veterinarian college. On her first night, a hazing ritual sees masked men invade the dorms and force the freshmen to march and crawl—half dressed—across the campus. I couldn’t believe how the students reacted. No one asserted themselves or fought back. Maybe it’s a cultural thing (it’s a French film) but the herd imagery felt too pointed.</p>
<p>The plot kicks in when another hazing ritual forces Justine—a lifelong vegetarian—to try meat. This first taste unlocks an insatiable craving for human flesh.</p>
<p>On the surface, <em>Raw</em> is about Justine discovering and battling her cannibalistic urges. But writer/director Julia Ducournau positions cannibalism as a metaphor for escaping overbearing parents, discovering one’s sexuality, defending animal rights, and struggling to escape an older sibling’s shadow.</p>
<p>Juggling so many metaphors leaves little time for subtlety. It’s frustrating. Several scenes made me uncomfortable but said discomfort felt manipulative and obnoxious. Other scenes fall apart upon reflection. Some scenes do both. The night following her first taste of meat, Justine awakens covered in huge itchy welts with swaths of her skin peeling off in dry sheets. She yawns and goes back to sleep.</p>
<p>Still, <em>Raw</em> has its strengths. The cinematography grabbed my attention from the opening shot, and the performances convince to the degree the script allows.</p>
<p>But I just couldn’t buy it. For a film desperate to frame its genre elements as a serious conceit, too many details strained credibility. Justine as a cannibal? Sure. But a campus full of kids not glued to their smartphones? Preposterous.</p>

              <h2>Deadpool</h2>
              <p>Beneath the crude jokes and over-the-top violence lurks a serious film.</p>
<p>Okay, not exactly, but <em>Deadpool</em> works because it takes its source material seriously.</p>
<p>Ryan Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson a former special forces operative turned mercenary with a heart of gold. Just as he meets the girl of his dreams and finds the happiness that&#39;s eluded him all his life, Wade learns he&#39;s developed terminal cancer. A mysterious organization reaches out with the promise of a cure. Wade accepts, but the cure carries at a steep price. Presumed dead, Wade embarks on a mission of vengeance, complete with running color commentary.</p>
<p><em>Deadpool</em> plays as a self-aware comic book film. The first time I watched it, I laughed so hard I missed most of the jokes. Besides the non-stop non-sequiturs, we get jokes about the plot, jokes about the other <em>X-Men</em> films, and jokes about the limited budget. They&#39;re not belittling the genre, just mining it for laughs.</p>
<p>And these laughs come wrapped in a solid origin story. The film invests time in Wade and his relationships, making him more than a clown.</p>
<p>Most of the credit goes to Reynolds. His deadpan comedy proves the perfect match for the character&#39;s gallows humor. He doesn&#39;t just carry the film, he propels it along with his considerable charisma. This despite having essentially a voice-over role for most of his scenes.</p>
<p>It&#39;s said one can mark a genre&#39;s end when it devolves into comedy, as <em>Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)</em> ended the Universal Monster era. But that needn&#39;t be the case. Rather than transplant genre characters into a comedic film, <em>Deadpool</em> takes a genre film and adds liberal doses of comedy. It&#39;s a subtle but important distinction. <em>Deadpool</em> may be hilarious, but it&#39;s a comic book movie first, and a comedy second.</p>

              <h2>Shock</h2>
              <p>You won&#39;t believe me when I tell you not to watch <em>Shock</em>.</p>
<p>Especially if you&#39;re a Vincent Price fan. The plot alone will convince you it&#39;s worth watching. Price plays a psychiatrist who murders his wife. Unbeknownst to him, Anabel Shaw&#39;s character witnesses the murder from her hotel room. The sight renders her catatonic and she falls under the care of—you guessed it—Price&#39;s character. Better still: Shaw&#39;s character spies the murder only after waking from an anxiety-laden nightmare, calling into question her reliability as a narrator.</p>
<p>It could play as a cross between <em>Rebecca (1940)</em> and <em>Suspicion (1941)</em>. Instead, it plays like <em>Double Indemnity (1944)</em>. There&#39;s no doubt Price&#39;s character is guilty. He&#39;s egged on by femme fatale Lynn Bari.</p>
<p>I can hear you saying to yourself, “That sounds interesting.”</p>
<p>I&#39;m here to tell you, it isn&#39;t. Price doesn&#39;t register as charming or sinister. He has zero chemistry with Bari, who herself fails to register as seductive or cunning. This renders the entire film rather boring, which as I&#39;ve written before, is a film&#39;s most unforgivable sin.</p>
<p>But let&#39;s face it: if you&#39;re a Vincent Price fan, you won&#39;t believe me. Price played this sort of role so well in so many later pictures, you can&#39;t fathom him falling flat. To those fans, I offer this condolence: if you make it through the film, you&#39;ll see the ending, which I found so unintentionally funny I laughed aloud. So that&#39;s something.</p>

              <h2>Breakfast at Tiffany's</h2>
              <p>It&#39;s Audrey Hepburn&#39;s movie, but George Peppard deserves some credit.</p>
<p>His performance channels a young William Holden or Steve McQueen. Sure, seeing colonel John &quot;Hannibal&quot; Smith play a romantic lead will shock those of a certain age, but the jolt is short-lived. Peppard pulls off the role with aplomb.</p>
<p>It starts with his clothes. Okay—not really, but I love his wardrobe.</p>
<p>Peppard plays Paul, a writer posing as a gigolo or vice versa. As the film opens, he&#39;s moving into a converted New York brownstone apartment. There he meets Holly Golightly, a quirky socialite played by Hepburn.</p>
<p>He falls for her. She for him. Complications ensue. What makes <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s</em> special is not the plot, but the characters.</p>
<p>Paul and Holly are both damaged people, skirting responsibility and commitment with a fear bordering on phobic. When Paul meets Holly he&#39;s drawn by her fragile nature. The diminutive Hepburn looks the part. Paul longs to swoop in and save Holly. Unlike her other suitors, Paul&#39;s in no position to save anyone, he&#39;s just as wounded.</p>
<p>Patricia Neal plays the rich, married woman who pays Paul&#39;s rent and keeps him in nice clothes. She makes an impression by underplaying her role. As does Buddy Ebsen as a lovesick figure from Holly&#39;s shadowy past.</p>
<p>It&#39;s this willingness to embrace flawed characters—and not flawed in cute ways, but morally suspect ones—that makes <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s</em> stand out.</p>
<p>Sure, we get plenty of soft focus close-ups, Mickey Rooney as a racist caricature meant as comic relief, and a finale set in a rainy, yet well-lit alley, but <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s</em> transcends the tropes.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint lies with the ending. Holly isn&#39;t a real person, she&#39;s a ghost, drifting in and out of people&#39;s lives, leaving an indelible impression. That Paul could end up with her doesn&#39;t ring true. She&#39;s not the girl you marry, she&#39;s the girl you wonder about years later.</p>
<p>Still, it&#39;s a great film and Hepburn deserves the kudos showered upon her performance. But it works because Peppard wins us over too.</p>

              <h2>Logan</h2>
              <p>It&#39;s taken 17 years, but <em>Logan</em> gives us the Wolverine we&#39;ve always wanted.</p>
<p>Hugh Jackman reprises the titular role for what he claims is the final time. Given the film&#39;s box office success, I consider his retirement suspect, but I digress.</p>
<p>The film opens with Logan jarred from a drunken stupor in the back seat of a car. He stumbles out to discover a gang of young thieves attempting to strip the car. He pleas for them to stop and the thieves shoot him without a moment&#39;s hesitation. He drops to the ground, apparently dead.</p>
<p>A beat passes and Logan struggles to his feet. The thieves turn, surprised. Once again, Logan appeals to reason. Again, the thieves shoot him. Logan&#39;s temper snaps, he lets loose a slew of obscenities and winces in anger as he unsheathes his claws. The thieves&#39; eyes go wide with terror as Logan snarls and charges forward, dismembering the punks in a bloody burst of violence.</p>
<p>This film earns its R-rating but doesn&#39;t wallow in it. The violence feels gritty but not gratuitous. This is Wolverine uncensored, ripped from the comics and thrust into the real world.</p>
<p>Well, almost. The time, we learn, is the near-future. The place is the southern US. Logan earns a low-profile living driving a limousine. He spends his meager earnings bribing hospital staff for the medication he administers to Charles Xavier, played once again by Patrick Stewart.</p>
<p>Forced into hiding, Logan and Xavier are all that remain of the X-Men. Xavier&#39;s succumbing to dementia, rendering his mind a potential weapon of mass destruction. Logan&#39;s mutant healing ability is fading and the adamantium lacing his bones is slowly poisoning him. Facing mortality and struggling to make ends meet, they are comic book heroes made human.</p>
<p>Well, almost. The plot kicks in when Logan discovers he has a daughter who&#39;s being hunted by a military-industrial conglomerate. As much as the film yearns to transcend the comic book genre, we get a cybernetic head bad guy, an evil Wolverine clone, and some magic healing juice that exists to facilitate the third act. These aren&#39;t deal-breakers, but they weaken the film&#39;s impact. With so much nonsense it&#39;s hard to take the serious parts, well, seriously.</p>
<p>Still, I enjoyed <em>Logan</em>, if for nothing more than Jackman and Stewart&#39;s performances. They make their characters feel familiar yet fresh and appear to relish the unidealized roles. That said, as the film unwound, I kept hoping Ian McKellen would turn up as Magneto. His scenes with Stewart were among the highlights of <em>X-Men (2000)</em>, and he deserves an encore. Hey, maybe reconsider that retirement, Hugh?</p>

              <h2>What We Do in the Shadows</h2>
              <p>Funny, clever, and gruesome—albeit overlong.</p>
<p><em>What We Do in the Shadows</em> is a mockumentary following four vampires sharing a house in Wellington, New Zealand.</p>
<p>The film works best when it satirizes reality TV and focuses on the minutia of household life. The vampires bicker over household chores, dress for a night out, and prepare dinner for their would-be victims. In these moments, the film shines. Watching them struggle to dress up without mirrors had me roaring.</p>
<p>As a genre fan, I liked how the film satirized multiple cinematic vampire incarnations. Everything from <em>Nosferatu (1922)</em> through <em>Twilight (2008)</em>. The interplay between these incarnations offers some of the film&#39;s best laughs. There&#39;s also a group of werewolves, lead by Rhys Darby in a scene-stealing performance.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed the film&#39;s willingness to embrace the gore. One horrific yet hilarious scene involves a vampire trying and failing to devour a victim without spraying blood all over an antique couch.</p>
<p>But about the length. Even at just 86 minutes, the film drags. The forced plot provides little emotional or comedic payoff and feels like dead weight. If reality TV can do without plot, why can&#39;t the film that skewers it? Given how much the film gets right, it&#39;s a petty quibble, but one that keeps <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em> shy of perfection.</p>
