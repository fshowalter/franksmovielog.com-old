Bear with me.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nReviewing this one without spoilers will prove difficult. Bear with me.\n\nDaniel Kaluuya stars as Chris, a young photographer. Chris's girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), takes him home to meet her parents at their remote estate. Chris is apprehensive because Rose hasn't told her family he's black. She assures him everything will be fine. Everything is not fine.\n\nForgive my not revealing more but, as Roger Ebert often said, it's not what the film is about, but how it is about it. With _Get Out_, writer/director Jordan Peele offers a horror film that's a meditation on racism in America, but not how you'd expect. Every time I thought I knew where he was going, Peele surprised me.\n\nThis extends to the execution. Horror films sink or swim based on how they handle the tropes. The best filmmakers define, perfect, upend, or avoid them. Peele embraces them.\n\nAllow me to spoil a single scene to make my point. It's the middle of the night. Chris has endured a rough day with Rose's family. He's tired, on edge, and can't sleep. He sneaks out for a cigarette. Outside he sees—wait, I changed my mind. I can't spoil the scene; it's too good. But consider how Peele embraces the trope of drawing the protagonist into a spooky situation. Chris doesn't investigate an odd noise, or similar clunky idiot plot behavior, his motives feel organic. As for what he sees, well, it's scary, bizarre and humorous all at once. Peele leverages the setup's inherent suspense and channels it into an original payoff. It's genre Aikido.\n\nIndeed, aside from Rose's brother's part feeling underwritten or severely edited, the film shines. It's not until the third act, when the film's cards are on the table, that it falters. We've grown so enamored with Peele's ability to repurpose the genre's staples, that it feels like a letdown when he indulges in a few.\n\nOn this point, I'm torn. I love the third act's gleefully gory, over the top nature, but it feels like a safety net. Like a comedian following a raw emotional truth with a punchline. The finale plays well, but Peele earned a darker, more honest ending.\n\nI can't wait to see what he does next.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/9b7de/get-out-2017.jpg","srcSet":"/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/eb003/get-out-2017.jpg 200w,\n/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/11f33/get-out-2017.jpg 400w,\n/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/9b7de/get-out-2017.jpg 800w,\n/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/29626/get-out-2017.jpg 1200w,\n/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/0a886/get-out-2017.jpg 1600w,\n/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/032f3/get-out-2017.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"13 Mar 2017","grade":"D","slug":"the-telegraph-trail-1933","sequence":"82","movie":{"title":"The Telegraph Trail","runtimeMinutes":54,"originalTitle":"The Telegraph Trail","year":1933,"directors":[{"fullName":"Tenny Wright"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"Young John Wayne gets his best supporting cast in years, but the resulting picture still stinks.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nYoung John Wayne gets his best supporting cast in years, but the resulting picture still stinks.\n\n_The Telegraph Trail_ was the fourth production, following _The Big Stampede (1932)_, under a six-picture contract Wayne signed with Warner Bros.

Along the way, they encounter hostile natives incited by corrupt trader Gus Lynch (Albert J. Smith). There's also the obligatory love interest for Wayne, played by Alice Keller.\n\nWayne's prior pictures for Warner Bros. saddled him with subpar supporting casts, but this time he gets McHugh, a great character actor, and Smith, a great heavy. But the lackluster result proves Wayne still had lots to learn. It doesn't help that he and Keller have minimal chemistry, or that the finale drags on far too long and reuses the same recycled footage multiple times.

Few films would dare hurtle so far over the top, and if they dared, they'd build up to it. _Island of Death_ gives us that scene in the first 15 minutes.\n\nIs it possible to make an unintentional parody? Director Nico Mastorakis offers no indication he sought to satirize the exploitation horror genre, but his film is so ridiculous, modern horror audiences are bound to take it as comedy.\n\nThe plot concerns a young couple played by Behling and Jane Lyle who arrive on the Greek island of Mykonos and embark on a thrill-kill spree. That's it. It doesn't pretend to have a deeper purpose or meaning. It's all shock for shock's sake.\n\nAnd yet, it's surprisingly well done. Mastorakis makes terrific use of the photogenic locales and enlivens the over-the-top violence with inventive camerawork. Consider the nocturnal chase through the city's labyrinthine alleys. Mastorakis heightens the sense of panic by using a fish-eye lens and several low-angles shots from the victim's point-of-view. In a lesser film, such choices would feel gimmicky, but they work here.\n\nThe assured photography contrasts with the uneven performances. Though the supporting players are either wooden or over-the-top, Behling and Lyle play their parts so straight they verge on camp. As parody, the performances are inspired. Behling's delivery alone is priceless.\n\nBy his own account, Mastorakis made _Island of Death_ after seeing _The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)_. That film's box-office success lead him to believe an even more extreme picture would make even more money. This naked ambition manifests in an everything-but-the-kitchen sink approach that pushes the film past any genuine scares or mean-spirited umbrage, and firmly into parody. Were I to enumerate the film's assorted affronts to good taste it would appear brutal, yet I came away entertained. _Island of Death_ isn't for everyone, but exploitation fans will love it.\n","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/0c624a40af81072bf3a8b1d9113a906e/9b7de/island-of-death-1976.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0c624a40af81072bf3a8b1d9113a906e/eb003/island-of-death-1976.jpg 200w,\n/static/0c624a40af81072bf3a8b1d9113a906e/11f33/island-of-death-1976.jpg 400w,\n/static/0c624a40af81072bf3a8b1d9113a906e/9b7de/island-of-death-1976.jpg 800w,\n/static/0c624a40af81072bf3a8b1d9113a906e/29626/island-of-death-1976.jpg 1200w,\n/static/0c624a40af81072bf3a8b1d9113a906e/0a886/island-of-death-1976.jpg 1600w,\n/static/0c624a40af81072bf3a8b1d9113a906e/032f3/island-of-death-1976.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"27 Feb 2017","grade":"F","slug":"cathys-curse-1977","sequence":"80","movie":{"title":"Cathy's Curse","runtimeMinutes":88,"originalTitle":"Cathy's Curse","year":1977,"directors":[{"fullName":"Eddy Matalon"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"How did a 40-year-old, little-seen Canadian horror movie land a 2k restoration and limited theatrical run?

It started with an internet movie review.\n\nBrian Collins publishes [Horror Movie a Day](http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/). For the site's first six years, Collins watched and reviewed a horror movie every single day. Two months into his run, buried in a fifty-film “Chilling Classics” DVD pack, Collins discovered _Cathy's Curse_. [His review](http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2007/04/cathys-curse.html) crowned it the “Best/Worst” film he'd seen.\n\nIf _Cathy's Curse_ was a cult film, Collins became the cult leader. As his site's audience grew, Collins kept recommending the film and even posted [a commentary track](http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2009/03/cathys-curse-commentary-now-live.html).\n\nAll this exposure convinced Severin Films to acquire the rights and sponsor a 2k restoration. In recognition of Collins' efforts, they invited him to record a new audio commentary for the Blu-ray release. Said release also included a limited theatrical run, which is how I found myself watching _Cathy's Curse_ on the big screen.\n\nThe story follows a couple and their young daughter as they move back into the husband's childhood home. A malevolent spirit possesses the daughter leading to lots of profanity, extreme acne, and several unexplained deaths.\n\nIt's as bad as [Collins' review](http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2007/04/cathys-curse.html) claims, with inane dialog, incomprehensible editing, and whiplash performances. Aside from one scene, where a drunken groundskeeper finds himself covered in snakes and spiders, it's a disaster.\n\nAnd yet, I found myself bored.\n\n_Cathy's Curse_ achieved cult status as a so-bad-it's-good film. One with flaws so obvious and fixable, it was as though the filmmakers were blissful idiots. But watching the restored digital projection, the film looked too good. Cleaning up the picture made the film feel less like an inept amateur effort and more like a lazy professional one. The added scenes smoothed over the worst editing mishaps but added to the film's glacial pacing. Several scenes elicit laughs, but they're few and farther between.

Then I realized he makes the film work.\n\nPicking up where _John Wick (2014)_ ended, we follow John Wick as he rebuilds his house, sends his car for repairs, and tries to resume a normal life. I liked how these scenes acknowledge the mess action pictures leave in their wake. But soon enough, a smarmy mafioso appears, calling in a marker and forcing Wick back into life as an assassin. We meet a delightful array of supporting characters and thrill as Wick offs dozens of bad guys using knives, guns, cars, pens—you name it—before an obligatory double-cross makes him the target of every assassin in New York City. The film doesn’t so much end as set up another installment.\n\nThis may read like a direct-to-video production, but _John Wick: Chapter 2_ transcends the action genre, thanks to Reeves. It starts with the cognitive dissonance he creates. How he marches through the film with a shadow limp. The closeups that betray his fifty-two years. The weariness behind his eyes that clashes with his surfer-dude delivery. How nothing in the film surprises him. I have a theory that ties it all together.\n\nConsider, if you will, that the John Wick universe, with its surreal characters, superhuman assassins, and over-the-top violence, isn’t attempting to pass as real. And consider further that the John Wick character isn’t reluctant to kill out of a moral quandary, but because he knows he can’t lose. In this respect, Reeves’ weary delivery fits perfectly. How many times has he played this story out? His final line, saying “I’ll kill them all,” isn’t a warning or a threat, but a plea. He’s already killed them all, countless times. He’s a self-aware action hero.\n\nSure, it’s a stretch, and the third installment will likely prove me wrong, but I’m looking forward to it, regardless.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"13 Feb 2017","grade":"C","slug":"malefique-2002","sequence":"78","movie":{"title":"Maléfique","runtimeMinutes":90,"originalTitle":"Maléfique","year":2002,"directors":[{"fullName":"Eric Valette"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Maléfique_ falls short of its potential.","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_Maléfique_ falls short of its potential.\n\nThe film opens with a man saying goodbye to his wife and young son.

We meet his cellmates: Lassalle, an older librarian who says little, Marcus, a brash young man whose large breast implants clash with his brawny physique, and Pâquerette, a man-child with a penchant for eating things.\n\nAfter establishing these characters and their interpersonal dynamics, the plot kicks into gear. The men discover an old diary that doubles as a spell book. Eager to escape, the men try some incantations but discover magic carries a high cost.\n\nI relished this premise. Taking four desperate (but not fierce) men and dangling a supernatural means of escape overflows with potential.\n\nCarrère and Lassalle are well-cast. As Carrère, Gérald Laroche provides a grounded audience surrogate whose gradual transformation into a bitter convict carries the film. As Lassalle, Philippe Laudenbach adds gravitas, communicating volumes with his weary looks.\n\nI was fine with Clovis Cornillac as Marcus, but his character felt underwritten—his transgenderedness regulated to a plot device. As Pâquerette, Dimitri Rataud’s performance felt artificial. I kept hoping the film would reveal Pâquerette as a calculating mastermind masquerading as an imbecile, but no.\n\nInstead, the story devolves into a predictable version of [_The Monkey’s Paw_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey's_Paw). What begins with echoes of Lovecraft ends like an episode of _Tales from the Crypt_.\n\nImagine a film that took these characters—one imprisoned in his body, one in his mind, one in his wealth—and explored their prisons and the lengths they would go for freedom. _Maléfique_ is not that movie.

Walking the streets one night, Sam passes an art gallery. Glancing inside, he spies a mysterious black-clad assailant attacking a woman with a knife. Unable to gain entry, Sam stands helpless as the attacker escapes and the woman lies bleeding on the floor pleading for help.\n\nHaunted by his memories, Sam joins the investigation, causing the killer to target him and his live-in girlfriend, played by Suzy Kendall.\n\nArgento's visual style grabs you from the get-go. Consider the art gallery scene. The establishing shot sees a bright light shining out of the building's glass facade, drawing our eyes along with Sam's. Inside, the woman's white dress blends with the white walls and floor, forcing our gaze to the black-clad assailant and the woman's crimson blood.\n\nIt's a terrific use of contrast; a technique that Argento perfects in my favorite shot, which I shall endeavor to describe. It occurs later in the film, Sam has tracked the killer into a darkened room. As Sam enters, Argento cuts to a wide shot. The only light comes from the doorway. Sam's silhouette moves to the center of the otherwise pitch-black screen. Then the lights come on and the colors reverse to startling effect. That Argento would even try such a tricky shot shows his confidence. That he pulls it off heralds a major talent.\n\nBut Argento's visual focus can also be a detriment, particularly when he treats his characters as props rather than people. The most grievous example comes when Suzy Kendall's character finds herself under siege by the killer. She flees into her apartment and locks and barricades the heavy door. She looks for another way out. Finding none, she crumbles to the bathroom floor and sobs hysterically while the killer stabs at the apartment door.\n\nSure, Argento gets some memorable shots of a wide-eyed Kendall clinging to the bathroom sink, but the scene lost me. By having her scour the apartment for an exit, Argento reveals the lack of another _entry_. After locking and barricading the door, she need only grab a weapon and wait. Granted, it might be a long wait—boring through inches of hardwood with a kitchen knife takes time—but should the killer poke a limb through, she could stab or bludgeon it. Instead, Argento has her wail around on the floor as though the killer were literally breathing down her neck.

Seeing Humphrey Bogart shed his terry cloth trench coat to reveal a deep-cut two-piece is comedy gold.\n\nBut the movie surrounding this scene? I watched it some years back and thought it awful. Revisiting it for this review reaffirmed my opinion.\n\nPriscilla Lane stars as Linda, a secretary in an advertising agency who dreams of climbing the corporate ladder and drawing a salary instead of wages.\n\nJust as her career takes off, she marries Jimmy, played by Wayne Morris. Jimmy is an ex-footballer from Princeton turned ad-man. When Linda works overtime and misses the big Princeton football game, Jimmy demands Linda quit her job. Linda agrees, and several months later they’ve settled into a bland suburban existence with Linda playing the role of dutiful housewife.\n\nStill ambitious, Linda arranges a promising business venture for Jimmy, but Jimmy turns it down. Furious, Linda leaves Jimmy and resumes her career. Soon, she’s near the top of the ladder, working long nights alongside fellow advertising executive Harry, played by Bogart.\n\nDespondent, Jimmy throws himself into his work and achieves a large measure of success. As Harry makes his feelings for Linda clear, Linda realizes she’ll have to choose between Harry and Jimmy. She chooses poorly.\n\nRomantic comedies require us to like at least one of the leads. In _Men Are Such Fools_, I loathed them both.\n\nJimmy displays no regard for Linda’s dreams and ambitions, behaving as though he’s entitled to her attention and affection. When Linda cancels a dinner date with Jimmy to sell her boss on an ad campaign, Jimmy crashes the meeting. When a senior executive talks to Linda at a party, Jimmy sulks in a corner rather than join in the conversation. And don’t forget Linda's near-unforgivable crime of missing the Princeton game with Jimmy and his fraternity buddies.\n\nJimmy’s so chauvinistic it’s almost comical. But everyone in the film acts as though his behavior is acceptable. They laugh and chalk it up to young love. That’s when you realize it’s not Jimmy who’s supposed to be funny, but Linda for prioritizing her career over a man.\n\nWhich brings us to Linda, who I loathed even more than Jimmy. You see, she doesn’t endure his behavior, she encourages it. Consider how Jimmy gets her to marry him. They’re at a pool party thrown by one of Linda’s bosses. Linda’s talking to a high level executive. Furious that Linda would dare talk to another man, Jimmy stalks across the party, grabs Linda, pulls her into the pool and demands she marry him. When Linda says no, he pushes her head under water. He waits a beat, then lets her up. As Linda gasps for air, Jimmy repeats his demand. Again she says no. Back under she goes. This repeats—in full view of the guests, most of whom are Linda's superiors at work—until Linda agrees. And when she does, it’s not with resentment, but with a doe-eyed smile full of adoration for this man who just bullied her into marrying him. Now, I ask you, who’s worse: the ass or the woman who reinforces the behavior?\n\nI was going to write something about the ending, and how it lacks a clear message, leaving you wondering just what the film was trying to say, but why bother? There’s only one way to enjoy _Men Are Such Fools_: 1. Start the movie. 2. Fast-forward to Bogart’s introduction. 3. Laugh at his outfit. 4. Turn off the movie.

It's that kind of movie.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nWatching _Green Room_, I caught myself holding my breath. It's that kind of movie.\n\nThe story concerns a college-aged punk rock band who accept a gig at an out-of-the-way club in the Pacific Northwest. I'll reveal no more, lest I spoil how writer/director Jeremy Saulnier ratchets up the tension by raising the stakes with each plot twist. Suffice it to say, things get very bad, very fast for the young band.\n\n_Green Room_ is Saulnier's third film. His debut, _Murder Party (2007)_, was a flawed but entertaining black comedy. His follow-up, _Blue Ruin (2013)_, was a near-perfect revenge thriller. With _Green Room_, he delivers one of the more intense horror films I've seen.\n\nFrom the moment the band turns into the club's parking lot, we feel uneasy. A palpable sense of menace hangs in the air. It grows as the kids make their way inside the club. By the time they take the stage, it's overwhelming.\n\nLesser horror films force their characters to behave in service of the plot. We spend such films yelling “Get out of the house!” or something similar at the idiots on screen.\n\n_Green Room_ doesn't do this. Saulnier's characters behave true to their established personalities. The kids sense something's off, but they stay anyway. In part because they're desperate for cash, but more so because they love playing music, and the film conveys the transcendent joy they experience on stage. Later, when things turn bad, the kids continue to react in a plausible and relatable manner. They don't panic or fall for obvious traps. They play it smart. Except—and here lies the film's genius—Saulnier paints his villains even smarter. They don't panic or make stupid mistakes either. It's all so refreshing.\n\nIt's also gruesome. Saulnier punctuates his plot twists with sudden, brutal bursts of violence driven home with convincing practical effects. It's not a gore-fest, but it's not for the squeamish either.\n\nThat's because Saulnier makes sure we care about his characters. Good effects suspend disbelief but good storytelling generates empathy. Saulnier's prior efforts demonstrated a knack for creating flawed but endearing protagonists and quickly fleshing them out without resorting to awkward exposition or trite visuals. In _Green Room_, he gives us a whole band full. He even avoids gender stereotypes.\n\nYou may have noticed that I have not mentioned the cast. They're all convincing and engaging, but discussing specific performances, or even the casting itself would invite spoilers. That said, I'll make one exception since the film's promotional artwork includes him.\n\nHow I envy the festival audiences who went in knowing little more than the film's title and director. Patrick Stewart's reveal as a neo-Nazi gang leader must have been a terrific surprise. He's an unconventional choice, but he pulls off the part. Granted, he's not as scary as say, Ben Kingsley in _Sexy Beast (2000)_ or Stacy Keach in _American History X (1998)_, but maybe that's a good thing. _Green Room_ is intense enough.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"16 Jan 2017","grade":"F","slug":"the-big-stampede-1932","sequence":"74","movie":{"title":"The Big Stampede","runtimeMinutes":54,"originalTitle":"The Big Stampede","year":1932,"directors":[{"fullName":"Tenny Wright"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_The Big Stampede_ has little to recommend it.","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_The Big Stampede_ has little to recommend it.\n\nIt was the third production, following _Ride Him, Cowboy (1932)_, under a six-picture contract John Wayne signed with Warner Bros. It's a remake of _The Land Beyond the Law (1927)_.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. acquired First National Pictures a few years prior, they inherited the rights to several popular silent westerns starring Ken Maynard. These were A-list productions showcasing Maynard's impressive stunt work.\n\nWarner Bros. sought to remake the Maynard silents with sound, recycling as much action footage as possible, reshooting only the close-ups and interiors. They just needed an actor who matched Maynard's build. Enter Wayne.\n\nExcept, _The Big Stampede_ doesn't offer much action. Wayne plays John Steele, a deputy lawman sent to clean up the New Mexico territory.\n\nHe arrives in town and poses as a drunken drifter while sizing up local cattle baron Sam Crew. Then John is on the frontier, befriending a wagon train leader named Cal and making eyes at Cal's niece Ginger. Then the train comes under attack from Sam Crew's gang. To apprehend the gang, John recruits Sonora Joe, a Mexican bandit who first tries to rustle the wagon train's cattle.\n\nIf this sounds disjointed, then I have conveyed the sense of watching this film. The script abandons plot threads with no regard for logic or continuity. It also contains an inordinate number of speaking parts.\n\nWhich begs the question: If the point of remaking the Maynard films was to save money, why shoot such a complex and talky script? Casting and shooting so much new footage cost time and money. The only memorable bit of recycled footage is the titular stampede, which provides the film's climax. The wide shots of rampaging cattle and runaway wagons impress. The spliced in close-ups of Wayne shouting things like “Hoo-ah!” do not.\n\nSpeaking of Wayne, like much of the cast, he appears ill at ease. His scenes with Mae Madison, who plays Ginger, are stiff and awkward. Only Luis Alberni, who plays Sonora Joe, acquits himself well; though hardly well enough to recommend this dull mess.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"09 Jan 2017","grade":"A-","slug":"ocean-s-thirteen-2007","sequence":"73","movie":{"title":"Ocean's Thirteen","runtimeMinutes":122,"originalTitle":"Ocean's Thirteen","year":2007,"directors":[{"fullName":"Steven Soderbergh"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Ocean's Thirteen_ resurrects the caper picture.","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_Ocean's Thirteen_ resurrects the caper picture.\n\nWhat is a caper? It's a film centered on an elaborate ruse perpetrated by lovable rogues. The genre peaked with _The Sting (1973)_, then gave way to the grittier heist genre. But while heists get bloody, capers are rarely life-and-death scenarios. Today, the caper picture lies largely forgotten, save the occasional farcical comedy. But director Steven Soderbergh proves the old genre has legs.\n\nThis film's lovable rogues come together to avenge their mentor (Elliott Gould) who's been double-crossed by casino mogul Willy Bank (Al Pacino).\n\nTo get even, the group plans to rob Bank's casino. The film's joy lies in how they go about it. The casino's security system offers only a three-and-a-half minute window. To circumvent this obstacle, the group will rig the games to pay out to everyone. The group needn't win, just for the casino to lose. So, for three-and-a-half minutes, everybody wins.\n\nOf course, folks don't leave when they're running hot and if they stay, they'll just lose back their winnings. The thieves' solution to this dilemma provides another of the film's quirky surprises.\n\nA lesser film might drag under such plotting, but _Ocean's Thirteen_ breezes along, thanks to its all-star cast. Opposite Pacino, George Clooney and Brad Pitt star as the lead thieves with Matt Damon as their de facto lieutenant. Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner, and Eddie Izzard round out the crew.\n\nThe performers relish the script's rapid-fire dialogue. Peppered with invented slang and meta references, it's the film's biggest treat, and holds up to repeat viewings. The first scene between Clooney and Pacino, with Clooney echoing Pacino's dialog from _The Godfather (1972)_ always makes me smile.\n\nBut my favorite scene is audacious. It opens with Pitt and Clooney strolling along the Las Vegas Strip, reminiscing. They stop and Clooney gestures off-camera, saying, “I remember when this used to be the Dunes.”\n\nPitt looks down the street, “The Sands was there, and the Desert Inn…”\n\nCut to a close-up. Both men stand lost in their memories.\n\nClooney says, “They built them a lot smaller back then.”\n\nPitt, still looking where The Sands once stood, says, almost to himself, “They seemed pretty big.”\n\nAnother beat, then Clooney says, “Towns change,” and Soderbergh cuts to a wide shot reveal of the Bellagio dwarfing Clooney and Pitt.\n\nI love this scene. Such self-indulgence should elicit a groan, but between the crackerjack editing and sheer charisma of his stars, Soderbergh gets away with it. It's a caper-within-a-caper and I fall for it every viewing.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"02 Jan 2017","grade":"B-","slug":"christmas-evil-1980","sequence":"72","movie":{"title":"Christmas Evil","runtimeMinutes":100,"originalTitle":"You Better Watch Out","year":1980,"directors":[{"fullName":"Lewis Jackson"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Christmas Evil_ isn't the sleazy Santa slasher you'd expect.","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_Christmas Evil_ isn't the sleazy Santa slasher you'd expect.\n\nThe film opens on Christmas Eve. A young boy named Harry wanders downstairs and spies his father, dressed as Santa, fondling his half-naked mother.\n\n*I know, I said the film wasn't sleazy. Stay with me.*\n\nFast-forward thirty years and Harry (now played by Brandon Maggart) has developed an obsession with Santa. His shabby apartment overflows with Christmas knick-knacks and Santa artwork. He spies on the neighborhood children and catalogs their activities in large tomes dedicated to the naughty and nice. He even works in a dingy toy factory.\n\nOn Christmas Eve night, Harry dons his handmade Santa costume. At first, he's overjoyed as he delivers toys to children in a mental hospital. But then his attention turns to the naughty and his mood darkens. A chance confrontation turns violent and bloody. Harry flees, unsure what went wrong. He finds solace in a neighborhood Christmas party where he's the delight of the local children. But soon he's alone again, and the high of the party gives way to another dangerous low. More violence follows, spiraling out of control and leading to an outrageous finale that I dare not reveal, but which casts the film as a bittersweet fable.\n\nI admit, I went in expecting a cheesy bit of exploitation but I came out impressed. I liked the film's production. There's nary a soundstage in sight. Everything is location-based, including the New Jersey exteriors. The worn, lived-in interiors give the film a documentary veneer and added authenticity.\n\nBut most of all, I liked the film's willingness  to tell a different kind of story. It hit me during the third act, which sees Harry fleeing a mob of torch-wielding neighbors, that writer/director Lewis Jackson wasn't making a slasher picture at all, he was making a monster movie.\n\nConsider the similarities to _Frankenstein (1931)_. Both serve as cautionary tales. _Frankenstein_ warned against playing God. _Christmas Evil_ warns against playing Santa. It's a laughable notion until you consider it from a child's perspective. Moral absolutes like naughty and nice don't work in the adult world, but try explaining that to a child. The film commits to this premise.\n\nTo that end, Maggart's performance makes the film. His character is very much a child trapped in a middle-aged body, and Maggart convinces. The audience I saw the film with offered no snarky chuckles or giggles; they sat transfixed. Much as in _Frankenstein_, we come to care about this misunderstood monster. The script helps by ensuring Harry never harms a child. It reserves Harry's murderous outbursts for the film's real creeps: the other adults. It's an important detail that lets the film earn its ending.\n\nThe more I think about _Christmas Evil_, the more I admire it. Will it hold up to repeat viewings? I'll let you know next Christmas.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"26 Dec 2016","grade":"F","slug":"jack-frost-1997","sequence":"71","movie":{"title":"Jack Frost","runtimeMinutes":89,"originalTitle":"Jack Frost","year":1997,"directors":[{"fullName":"Michael Cooney"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Jack Frost_ is bad, even by “movie about a killer snowman” standards.

And those are low standards.\n\nThe plot concerns—well, I’ve already mentioned the killer snowman, yes? Then, for most readers, I have described the plot in sufficient detail. For those still curious, the film opens with Federal agents transporting a serial killer (named Jack Frost, of course) to his execution. The icy conditions cause the paddy wagon to collide with a top-secret government tanker truck. The truck’s contents spray out, melting the killer's skin and bones. His liquid remains merge with the snow, granting him a second life as a snowman.\n\nIt's a reasonable setup. The problem lies in the execution. Had the film played as a straight horror whose antagonist happens to be a snowman, it might have worked. Just imagine the absurdist humor in swapping Michael Myers for a snowman in _Halloween (1978)_. But _Jack Frost_ drowns in a sea of camera winks and awkward comedy bits. It’s not a horror film, it’s a manufactured attempt at “so-bad-it’s-good” schlock.\n\nFor that approach to work, the titular killer snowman needs to be an anti-hero; someone we can perversely root for as he offs the self-centered jerk taking up two parking spaces during the holiday rush, the obnoxious boss who overworks his employees on Christmas Eve, and yes, even the ungrateful kid who’s unhappy with his gifts.\n\n_Jack Frost_ offers no such vicarious thrills. The serial killer turned snowman is out to fulfill a petty revenge pact against the small-town sheriff who arrested him. It’s an uninspired plot for an uninspired film that’s neither scary nor funny; and thus, not worth your time.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"19 Dec 2016","grade":"A+","slug":"straw-dogs-1971","sequence":"70","movie":{"title":"Straw Dogs","runtimeMinutes":113,"originalTitle":"Straw Dogs","year":1971,"directors":[{"fullName":"Sam Peckinpah"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"Sam Peckinpah's _Straw Dogs_ is an ugly, brutal, nihilistic, gut-punch of a horror film.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nSam Peckinpah's _Straw Dogs_ is an ugly, brutal, nihilistic, gut-punch of a horror film.\n\nHorror fans will recognize the plot. A young couple moves to a small, isolated village where they hope to renovate an old house. They ignore repeated warnings to leave and bad things happen, culminating in the young lovers barricading themselves in their home, fighting to keep an unspeakable evil from gaining entry.\n\nThe difference is in the details. _Straw Dogs_ takes place in an English village; the quaint sort you see in romantic comedies. But instead of charming, quirky characters, the residents of this hamlet are leering, hard-drinking thugs.\n\nInto this rural jungle comes mild-mannered American mathematician David (Dustin Hoffman) and his attractive wife Amy (Susan George). They're fleeing some vague unrest in America and the village is her childhood home.\n\nAs we meet David and Amy, we get our first indication the film will stray from the formula. They aren't the typical idyllic couple thrust into danger. David's condescending manner alienates the few locals who would befriend him but he's too self-absorbed to notice. His intellectual snobbery leads him to treat Amy like a child. Amy's petulant responses only reinforce the behavior. Their bickering rings true.\n\nThe plot kicks in when some local men, including a former boyfriend of Amy's, named Charlie, worm their way into a job repairing the couple's garage roof. The men drag out the work. They ogle Amy. One sneaks into the house and steals a pair of Amy's panties, which he later flaunts at the pub. Things reach a tipping point when David and Amy discover their cat hung in their bedroom closet. When David proves reluctant to confront the men, Amy presses the issue. David snaps at her. She calls him a coward.\n\nThis conflict between David and Amy sets up the film's most controversial scene: Charlie raping Amy.\n\nIt's a hard scene to watch. I've seen the film multiple times, and it doesn't get any easier. At first, Amy screams and fights back. Charlie slaps her and she crumbles to the floor in slow motion. Resigned to her fate, Amy stops fighting.\n\nThen Peckinpah twists the knife. He quick cuts between the present and Amy's intimate memories of David. Amy's anger toward David swirls and churns inside her. Her resignation turns to passion as she turns from victim to betrayer and embraces her former lover.\n\nFinally, as Amy and Charlie lay entwined, Peckinpah goes for the jugular. One of Charlie's goon friends enters, holding a shotgun. With some reluctance, Charlie steps aside and watches his friend force himself on Amy at gunpoint. Amy's shrieks surround us as her violation is absolute.\n\nControversial? Absolutely. Gratuitous? No. The scene is horrifying but necessary. It drives an unspoken wedge between David and Amy, setting up the rest of the story.\n\nThe finale sees Charlie and gang laying siege to David and Amy's house. It's a familiar scene in horror films; the men could just as easily be zombies or other monsters, and Peckinpah uses lots of low-angle shots and foggy backlighting. But the real horror isn't what's trying to get in, it's what's coming out between David and Amy.\n\nA series of plot-driven coincidences have led to David sheltering a mentally challenged man in the couple's attic. The mob outside believes this man murdered a local girl earlier that evening. When the attacks start, Amy urges David to acquiesce to the mob's demands and turn the man over, but David refuses. Bitter that David will stand up for a stranger but not her, Amy refuses to help. This proves the turning point in their relationship. Later, when Amy's in trouble, she yells for Charlie.\n\nIt's easy to dismiss _Straw Dogs_ as misogynistic, but that's short-sighted. This film hates everyone. While Amy is assaulted, David's out hunting with the very men who attack her. Of course, the trip was just a ruse to lure him away, but David only accepted to buddy-up with alpha-male Charlie. David would label himself a pacifist but behaves as a sycophant.\n\nAnd that goes to what makes the film special. It's violent, sure, but it's not the violence that stays with you. Rather, it's the bleak reflection of human nature. Horror movies tend to paint their protagonists as bland, cookie-cutter stereotypes; their misfortune born out of some trespass or bad luck. Not here.\n\nThe horror of _Straw Dogs_ isn't that it could _happen_ to us, it's that the characters could _be_ us. By committing to its bleak vision the film projects authority. By making its protagonists monsters themselves, the film transcends the exploitation genre. It may not be entertaining in the conventional sense, but every viewing stays with me for days. I may not like what _Straw Dogs_ is saying, but I can't deny its impact.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"05 Dec 2016","grade":"B+","slug":"the-getaway-1972","sequence":"69","movie":{"title":"The Getaway","runtimeMinutes":123,"originalTitle":"The Getaway","year":1972,"directors":[{"fullName":"Sam Peckinpah"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_The Getaway_ is a slick bit of neo-noir exploitation.","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_The Getaway_ is a slick bit of neo-noir exploitation.\n\nSteve McQueen stars as Doc McCoy, an incarcerated bank robber.

His price.”\n\nBeynon (Ben Johnson) is a greasy operator who sits on the parole board. He pulls some strings and Doc is paroled.\n\nDoc's reunion with Carol is a touch of genuine sweetness that transcends the film's exploitative nature. The near-wordless scenes convey the sudden change in their lives. Reunited, the two experience a brief respite before Doc meets with Beynon to repay his debt.\n\nThe job is a local bank. Beynon has already picked the crew. Doc would rather use his own guys, but Beynon won't budge. With no leverage, Doc agrees.\n\nThe robbery, of course, goes wrong. One of Beynon's guys panics. Things get bloody. In his trademark fashion, director Sam Peckinpah renders each fatality in graphic slow motion.\n\nThirty minutes into the film, the real story begins. Doc and Carol head for Mexico with the loot. The law and Beynon's gang pursue.\n\nI love how the film avoids painting Doc as a hero. He kills without hesitation. There's even a rough scene where smacks Carol. And yet, McQueen's performance engenders sympathy. You sense Doc's desire to be a better man but fear he'll lose the battle.\n\nIt's part of the film's overall sense of dread. In pursuit of Doc, one of Beynon's gang takes a husband and wife hostage. The wife falls for their captor, degrading herself and humiliating her husband. As Doc and Carol flee, you're sure they won't make it. Even when they escape, you're certain the next close-call will be their last. Chalk that up to Peckinpah's commitment to grounding the film in a plausible reality.\n\nThe sets look worn and dusty. The characters glisten with a perpetual sheen of sweat from the oppressive Texas heat. They eat greasy cheeseburgers, hole up in dingy motels, and travel in oversized cars.\n\nAnd those cars make for gripping chase scenes. As characters panic, oversteer, fishtail, and crash, you appreciate the challenge of controlling such large vehicles at high speeds.\n\nBut the film's highlight belongs to an on-foot chase. After a con-man switches locker keys with Carol and snags the loot, Doc engages in a desperate pursuit through a crowded train station. The dialog-free sequence crackles with tension and echoes vintage Hitchcock.\n\nScenes like this, along with McQueen's charisma and Peckinpah's stylish editing help gloss over the clunky plot. _The Getaway_ may be little more than pulp, but it's damn entertaining.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"28 Nov 2016","grade":"C","slug":"doctor-strange-2016","sequence":"68","movie":{"title":"Doctor Strange","runtimeMinutes":115,"originalTitle":"Doctor Strange","year":2016,"directors":[{"fullName":"Scott Derrickson"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Doctor Strange_ offers ephemeral entertainment.","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_Doctor Strange_ offers ephemeral entertainment.\n\nSet in the Marvel cinematic universe, the film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange, a hotshot neurosurgeon.

There he meets The Ancient One, played by Tilda Swinton, who trains him in the mystic arts.\n\nStrange proves himself an exceptional student. Good thing, as he’s soon under attack from Kaecilius, the Ancient One’s former star pupil. Kaecilius now serves Dormammu, an ancient entity from the Dark Dimension. Soon, Strange is all that stands between Earth and a horrible (but not well explained) fate.\n\nWe’ve seen this story before in countless martial arts films. An acolyte approaches a great master for training, excels against the odds, then clashes with the master’s once favorite student. This film merely substitutes magic for kung-fu.\n\nThe problem lies in the homogenized and watered-down execution. Strange’s arc revolves around him overcoming his arrogance. But the film paints him as a brilliant surgeon far ahead of his colleagues. Is that arrogance? Why not paint Strange as a real monster? The film doesn’t seem comfortable making Strange too unlikable. Thus, Cumberbatch’s Strange plays as a less fun version of Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark from the _Iron Man_ films. The resulting character feels thin and flat.\n\nThis extends to the villains. Mads Mikkelsen can play a great bad guy but fails to register as Kaecilius. The script gives him no edge. We’ve seen the disgruntled student archetype in countless films before, and _Doctor Strange_ offers nothing new. Even Dormammu, who should rank among the most horrific villains in the Marvel oeuvre, fails to terrify.\n\nThe special effects also fail to connect. We see cities twisting and folding upon themselves like Rubik’s Cubes, but the film fails to surround these scenes with a compelling story. Watching New York transform into an M.C. Escher style visage is impressive, but not engaging. The effects should serve the story, not substitute for it.\n\nThis sounds like I hated the film. I did not. Though I would have preferred his native British accent, I enjoyed Cumberbatch’s performance. The real star, however, is Tilda Swinton. She takes a throw-away archetype and delivers the film’s most memorable character. And as someone who grew up reading the comics, I loved seeing the sentient Cloak of Levitation, even if it was little more than comic relief.\n\nIndeed, after the obligatory post-credit sequence, I left the theater impressed with _Doctor Strange_. But in retrospect, I could remember images in the film, but none of my feelings upon seeing them.\n\nThere’s a reoccurring effect in the film where characters enter the Astral Plane. Their ethereal bodies float in the air and pass through solid objects. If they try hard enough, they can bump walls or knock things over. It’s an apt enough metaphor for the film.

And judging by the underwater scenes, he's doing some of his own stunts to boot.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"14 Nov 2016","grade":"C+","slug":"the-sentinel-1977","sequence":"66","movie":{"title":"The Sentinel","runtimeMinutes":92,"originalTitle":"The Sentinel","year":1977,"directors":[{"fullName":"Michael Winner"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"Chris Sarandon saves _The Sentinel_ from its own excess.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nChris Sarandon saves _The Sentinel_ from its own excess.\n\nThe film stars Cristina Raines as a fashion model who moves into a fantastic apartment in a converted Brooklyn brownstone. A series of strange encounters with her eccentric neighbors leaves her paranoid and on edge. Her boyfriend, a hot-shot defense attorney played by Sarandon, investigates and uncovers a horrific conspiracy involving the Catholic Church and a gateway to Hell.\n\nThe setup invites comparisons to _Rosemary’s Baby (1968)_. But unlike that film, which was about women's reproductive rights, _The Sentinel_ isn't about anything. It's an exploitation picture offering a smorgasbord of gore, nudity, lesbianism, human deformities, and female masturbation. I don't mind these things. I object to the film’s middling execution.\n\nMovie fans will enjoy spotting the once and future stars peppering the cast. José Ferrer as an unnamed robed figure. Ava Gardner as a charming real estate agent. Burgess Meredith as a creepy neighbor. Eli Wallach as a cagey detective. Christopher Walken as Wallach’s grinning partner. Jeff Goldblum as a fashion photographer. Beverly D’Angelo as a mute exhibitionist. An unrecognizable John Carradine as an aging priest.\n\nBut the film wastes its talented ensemble. It regulates most of the former stars, like Ferrer, Gardner, and Carradine, to throwaway roles for name recognition. Other performances veer into camp. Beverly D’Angelo’s memorable scene elicits chuckles instead of chills. Eli Wallach's phoned-in turn plays as caricature.\n\nThe sprawling cast is a byproduct of the convoluted, nonsensical plot. Consider the scene where a character breaks through a wall in the brownstone and uncovers a plaque bearing an inscription from Dante’s _Inferno_. It’s the film in a microcosm: effective and atmospheric, but its logic crumbles under the slightest scrutiny.\n\nWhat saved the film for me was Sarandon. Despite sporting a mustache that only adds to the film's second-rate feel, Sarandon is perfect in his role. He avoids the idiot plot and acts according to character. And there's just something about him playing a charming but ruthless character that I enjoy.\n\nThe first time I saw _The Sentinel_, I thought its mix of camp and shock hit more often than it missed—if only just. Watching it again, I’m not so sure. The performances don’t hold up well to repeat viewings, but Sarandon was every bit as good as I remembered.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"07 Nov 2016","grade":"B+","slug":"curse-of-the-demon-1957","sequence":"65","movie":{"title":"Curse of the Demon","runtimeMinutes":95,"originalTitle":"Night of the Demon","year":1957,"directors":[{"fullName":"Jacques Tourneur"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"A producer's meddling keeps _Curse of the Demon_ from perfection.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nA producer's meddling keeps _Curse of the Demon_ from perfection.\n\nThe story sees American psychologist John Holden (Dana Andrews) travel to London. He's there to expose self-professed black magician Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis) as a fraud. Karswell tries to dissuade Holden, but Holden remains resolute. Karswell then announces Holden will die in three days. Holden is skeptical, but after a series of unexplained events, his skepticism crumbles and he begins to fear for his life.\n\nThis is the best kind of thriller: one populated by intelligent characters who behave according to their personalities, not the whims of the plot. It avoids cheap jump-scares. Instead, director Jacques Tourneur uses atmosphere to build tension. Shadowy hallways and darkened rooms keep us on edge. And, for the real horror, there's Niall MacGinnis.\n\nI loved MacGinnis' performance. It's a perfect combination of charm and menace. There's a great scene where Holden has broken into Karswell's palatial home. In the darkness, a house cat transforms into a leopard and attacks. Holden struggles for his life, only escaping once Karswell enters and turns on the lights. Karswell treats the intruding Holden as one would treat a party guest who'd gotten lost looking for the bathroom. By underplaying the role, MacGinnis makes the character all the more sinister. Christopher Lee built a career on similar performances. And yet, MacGinnis conveys a vulnerability beneath the bluster that adds unexpected depth.\n\nOpposite MacGinnis, Andrews delivers a curious turn. His cadence and speech patterns mimic John Wayne's. They're so similar, I wonder if it was a deliberate impersonation. This brings up an interesting tangent. The Duke played many roles in many movies, but he never made a straight horror picture. Judging by Andrews' performance here, Wayne could have pulled it off with flair.\n\nYet, despite the solid script, competent direction and inspired performances, _Curse of the Demon_ falters. The opening sequence sees the titular demon marching out of the woods. A similar sequence occurs at the film's end. In both, the demon’s mechanical movement and frozen expression scream rubber suit. My wife thought it resembled a homecoming float. Not only do these shots cheapen the film, they undermine any sense of ambiguity regarding Karswell's powers. Holden is the audience surrogate. His skepticism is our skepticism. But this falls apart when we know Karswell's powers are real from the outset. Instead of questioning things along with Holden, we grow impatient waiting for him to catch up. A great psychological thriller devolves into a cheap monster movie.\n\nWe can thank producer Hal E. Chester. He added the demon shots after principal photography wrapped. Tourneur and Andrews fought him on it. Writer Charles Bennett threatened to shoot Chester dead. They all lost. The studio, Columbia, did cut some footage for the American release, but not of the monster. What a shame.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"31 Oct 2016","grade":"B+","slug":"torso-1973","sequence":"64","movie":{"title":"Torso","runtimeMinutes":89,"originalTitle":"I corpi presentano tracce di violenza carnale","year":1973,"directors":[{"fullName":"Sergio Martino"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Torso_ executes a generic plot with panache.","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_Torso_ executes a generic plot with panache.\n\nThe film takes place in scenic Perugia, Italy. A masked killer strangles two female university students, sparking a manhunt. Another student thinks she recognizes the murder weapon, leading to threatening phone calls from the killer. Alarmed, she retreats to a cliff-side villa with four girlfriends, including an American exchange student, played by Suzy Kendall. The killer, of course, follows.\n\nIt plays as a mystery, inviting us to guess the killer’s identity. The script proffers a myriad of suspects, painting almost every male character as possessive, misogynistic, or perverted. The few that appear normal feel suspect by comparison. I admit, it fooled me.\n\nMystery aside, what I enjoyed most about _Torso_ was its style. There’s a scene where the killer tracks a girl through a swampy marsh. The lighting, camerawork, and editing create a kind of kinetic claustrophobia. The more she runs, the more her world shrinks. Even as the tension held me rapt, the sheer craft made me smile.\n\nAnd it gets better. The last act sees Kendall locked in a bedroom. She slides a piece of newspaper under the door, hoping to catch the key as she forces it out of the lock. I won't spoil what happens, but I will say this scene caps twenty-some dialog-free minutes that serve as a master class in suspense. They're so good, I forgave the finale, which sees the killer reveal his identity and explain his psychosis via some awkward and disappointing exposition.\n\nMy only problem with _Torso_ lies with its heroines. I liked how the film paints them as strong, independent women. Fleeing to a remote outpost wasn't the smartest move, but it was refreshing to see them do something besides run to the nearest man for protection. If only the script had provided them with distinct personalities. Aside from Kendall’s character, they felt interchangeable and never endeared themselves. It’s a common problem with mysteries. We learn more about the various red herrings than about the protagonists.","backdrop":null}}]},"more":{"nodes":[{"grade":"C+","slug":"the-pit-1981","sequence":"63","markdown":{"backdrop":null},"movie":{"title":"The Pit"}},{"grade":"B+","slug":"phantasm-1979","sequence":"62","markdown":{"backdrop":null},"movie":{"title":"Phantasm"}},{"grade":"C-","slug":"mars-attacks-1996","sequence":"61","markdown":{"backdrop":null},"movie":{"title":"Mars Attacks!"}},{"grade":"D","slug":"riders-of-destiny-1933","sequence":"60","markdown":{"backdrop":null},"movie":{"title":"Riders of Destiny"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":20,"skip":20,"numPages":6,"currentPage":2,"moreSkip":40,"moreLimit":4}}}
