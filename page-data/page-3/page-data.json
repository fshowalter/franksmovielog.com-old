He’s noticed girls and nudie-books, but still clings to his teddy bear. When his parents take a trip, Jamie develops a crush on the live-in babysitter.\n\nIt’s a reasonable set-up for a coming-of-age comedy, but the script takes a different direction. Jamie’s teddy bear urges him to do things. Bad things, like watch his babysitter while she sleeps, or terrorize a neighbor into stripping nude as he snaps Polaroids, or frame a man for murder, or feed people to a pit of trolls.\n\nThe way the movie lumps the titular pit in with Jamie’s other deviations is part of its quirky charm. The troll effects look cheap, and the entire premise of luring people into a giant hole in the woods is silly. It’s as though the filmmakers knew they couldn’t make these bits scary, so they opted for weird. It works. Instead of a forgettable monster movie we get oddball schlock. And I love how obnoxious the film paints Jamie’s victims. Early on, Jamie, looking lonesome, approaches an older boy and girl. Jamie says little more than “Hi,” before the older boy punches him in the face. No reason, the boy’s just mean. When Jamie feeds him to the trolls, we’re not sad.\n\nBut there’s another movie lurking beneath the inanity. A much darker one. Bits and pieces surface, like Jamie alluding to his mother molesting him, or the aforementioned scene where he watches his babysitter sleep. These scenes transcend the schlock and convey a genuine sense of unease.\n\nTo that end, _The Pit_ is unlike anything I’ve seen. It’s not a good film, but its off-beat nature intrigues. You laugh as Jamie wheels an old biddy into the pit, then feel your skin crawl as he hits on his babysitter. It’s a wild ride.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"17 Oct 2016","grade":"B+","slug":"phantasm-1979","sequence":"62","movie":{"title":"Phantasm","runtimeMinutes":89,"originalTitle":"Phantasm","year":1979,"directors":[{"fullName":"Don Coscarelli"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"I was still watching Saturday morning cartoons and struggling with cursive writing when I first saw _Phantasm_. It traumatized  me.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nI was still watching Saturday morning cartoons and struggling with cursive writing when I first saw _Phantasm_. It traumatized  me.\n\nIt’s told from a kid’s point-of view. A boy who’s put away his toys but hasn't yet discovered girls. His parents died a few months earlier in a car crash. Now, he follows his older brother everywhere. In the process, he uncovers some strange goings-on involving the local mortician, played by Angus Scrimm.\n\nI love how writer-director Don Coscarelli avoids traditional plot tropes. When no one believes him, the kid breaks into the mortuary. After evading a lethal flying ball, he escapes with a gruesome piece of evidence. The next morning, he shows his older brother, who takes a single look and says, “Okay, I believe you.” A lesser film would see the boy lose the evidence during his escape, or have the older brother dismiss it with some awkward rationalization.\n\nI won’t reveal any more of the plot, as much of the film's joy comes from the unexpected directions it takes. It plays like a surreal nightmare. Scenes feel disjointed. We often sense we’re missing something. These seeming plot holes only add to the film’s unrelenting sense of unease.\n\nThough it’s often lumped in with the slasher pictures that dominated early 80s horror, _Phantasm_ stands apart. It’s equal parts science fiction and dark fantasy. Take out the brief nudity and iconic chrome ball, and you'd have a PG-13 film.\n\nBut about that ball. Those with squeamish stomachs may find it rough. As a special effect, it’s a collision of imagination,  exploitation, and blood. Lots of blood.\n\nThat ball pushed my younger self over the edge. I had nightmares for weeks. So much of the film, from the stark white mortuary interiors to Scrimm himself, looks unsettling. It sounds unsettling too, with an ominous, disconcerting score that adds to the film's impact.\n\nWatching it now, _Phantasm_ plays like a remake of the film I saw as a child. Scenes tug at memories of a more brutal experience. One that carved itself into my malleable psyche and sewed the seeds of my predilection for nihilistic, nightmarish horror. _Phantasm_ may not be perfect, but it made an impression.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"10 Oct 2016","grade":"C-","slug":"mars-attacks-1996","sequence":"61","movie":{"title":"Mars Attacks!","runtimeMinutes":106,"originalTitle":"Mars Attacks!","year":1996,"directors":[{"fullName":"Tim Burton"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Mars Attacks!_ could have been awful but settles for mediocre.","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_Mars Attacks!_ could have been awful but settles for mediocre.\n\nThe film jumps between several storylines as aliens from Mars attack Earth. We follow the President and his staff, a pair of television personalities, a family in rural Kansas, a sleazy Las Vegas developer, and a washed up heavyweight boxer. Jack Nicholson leads an all-star cast as both the President and the Vegas developer.\n\nThe studio advertised the film as spoofing 1950s science-fiction pictures, but it doesn’t play that way. Among the cast, it's telling that amateur actor and former NFL fullback Jim Brown seems the most comfortable. He plays the boxer reduced to dressing as a pharaoh for an Egyptian-themed casino. When the Martians attack, Brown heads out to reunite with his ex-wife (Pam Grier) and kids. He gets some help from Tom Jones, who plays himself. There’s a wonderful scene where Brown asks Jones, “Do you know how to fly a plane?” to which Jones replies, “Of course! You got one?”\n\nThis sort of goofball casting matches the goofy sci-fi premise.  Brown and Jones both seem aware of their shortcomings as actors, and their stiff performances are genuine and entertaining.\n\nIt’s a glimpse of the movie I suspect director Tim Burton wanted to make. He seems less interested in spoofing the genre than recreating it.\n\nThat’s not a bad idea, but no one told the big-name cast. Few appear to enjoy the material. Most convey a sense of condescension, their performances screaming “I’m overacting on purpose!”.\n\nDid they have a choice? Unlike Brown and Jones, the rest of the cast can’t pretend they’re amateurs. And playing it straight wouldn’t have helped. Pam Grier plays her role with such conviction, her scenes feel spliced in from a different film. Martin Short plays his role as though he were in an overt comedy, to similar effect.\n\nAt least they got the Martians right. The 1950s films featured serious monsters cobbled together with silly effects. Here, we get cartoonish villains brought to life with no visible wires, seams, or zippers. In my favorite scene, the Martians laser a national monument, catch the falling debris with their flying saucer, and redirect the rubble onto a fleeing tour group.\n\nStill, _Mars Attacks!_ underwhelms. It’s a rare movie that would be much better were it much worse.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"03 Oct 2016","grade":"D","slug":"riders-of-destiny-1933","sequence":"60","movie":{"title":"Riders of Destiny","runtimeMinutes":53,"originalTitle":"Riders of Destiny","year":1933,"directors":[{"fullName":"Robert N.

The voice isn't Wayne's, and it's clear he won't win any lip-sync awards. After his introduction, Wayne evades some bad guys in a scene that tries for slapstick but fails. Soon, he’s embroiled in a water-rights dispute between some ranchers and a shady businessman. Suffering from laughable dialog and stilted pacing, the film works best when it cuts to the action.\n\nOverseen by Yakima Canutt, the stunts pack a raw, visceral energy. One, a horse and rider diving off a cliff into a lake, proved so impressive, the studio recycled it for later productions.\n\nThis was John Wayne's first film for Monogram Pictures. Over the next two years, Monogram would cast Wayne as the lead in 16 productions, all westerns. They were quick and cheap shoots, wrapping in a week with budgets of around ten-thousand dollars.\n\nWith these films, Wayne began crafting his on-screen image. During production, he bonded with the stuntmen over drinks and card games. Many were real cowboys. Wayne’s desire to emulate their physicality and mannerisms formed the foundation of his iconic posture, gait, and cadence.\n\nI wouldn't recommend _Riders of Destiny_, but for John Wayne fans it's an opportunity to watch the fledgling actor workshop a persona that would become legend.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"26 Sep 2016","grade":"A","slug":"the-witch-2015","sequence":"59","movie":{"title":"The Witch","runtimeMinutes":92,"originalTitle":"The VVitch: A New-England Folktale","year":2015,"directors":[{"fullName":"Robert Eggers"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_The Witch_ gets better with each viewing.","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_The Witch_ gets better with each viewing.\n\nWithout revealing too much, the story follows a Puritan family exiled from their plantation in 17th century New England. Alone in the wild, they establish a small farm outside a looming forest. Tragedies beset them. As the stress mounts, they turn against one another, unaware of the horror lurking in the woods nearby.\n\nThe film requires active listening. Writer-director Robert Eggers sourced his dialog from documents and diaries written during the film’s period. The resulting English sounds a step removed from our own, packed with thees and thous and unfamiliar inflections. Those expecting to sit back, tune out, and be entertained may find themselves frustrated.\n\nBut Eggers rewards our attention. The film’s credibility astounds. The production built a working farm and lit it with near-natural light sources. Eggers scoured Canada for a forest that could pass for New England woodland. The remote location he chose doubles well enough, yet still seems alien and ominous. It’s an immersive experience.\n\nThe cast helps. Everyone impresses, but Anya Taylor-Joy astounds. Her performance as a teenage girl coming of age on a puritanical farm feels both original and authentic, and  she delivers it with startling ease. The only thing I didn't buy were her teeth. Like the rest of the cast, they were too perfect. In a lesser picture, I wouldn't have noticed.\n\nThis isn’t a film of jump-scares or gory set pieces. The story unfolds with a grim, nihilistic inevitability. Take out the supernatural elements and you still have a riveting drama.\n\nAnd that’s what makes _The Witch_ so special. It works as a horror movie. It works as a drama. It works as a fable. It works as an indictment of patriarchal societies. Like all great films, it rewards subsequent viewings. Whether you're savoring the attention to detail, or exploring the subtext, the film satisfies. As of this writing, I’ve seen it twice. That's not nearly enough.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"19 Sep 2016","grade":"D+","slug":"ride-him-cowboy-1932","sequence":"58","movie":{"title":"Ride Him, Cowboy","runtimeMinutes":55,"originalTitle":"Ride Him, Cowboy","year":1932,"directors":[{"fullName":"Fred Allen"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"In _Ride Him, Cowboy_, a town puts a horse on trial for attempted murder.

This may not be the film's most ridiculous scene.\n\nThis was the second production, following _Haunted Gold (1932)_, under a six-picture contract John Wayne signed with Warner Bros. It’s a remake of _The Unknown Cavalier (1926)_.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. acquired First National Pictures a few years prior, they inherited the rights to several silent westerns starring Ken Maynard. These were popular, A-list productions featuring Maynard’s impressive stunt work.\n\nWarner Bros. sought to remake the Maynard silents with sound, recycling as much footage as possible, reshooting only the close-ups and interiors. All they needed was an actor who matched Maynard’s build. Enter Wayne.\n\nWayne plays a wandering cowboy who tries to apprehend a mysterious outlaw known as The Hawk, only to end up framed for the outlaw's crimes.\n\nThe opening sequence reveals The Hawk's identity, so there's no mystery. It also telegraphs the finale by introducing someone who can identify The Hawk. Granted, said person lies comatose but, as the doctor says, “He'll be fine.”\n\nThis absurdity continues to the aforementioned horse trial, through Wayne's introduction, and to his framing. This consists of The Hawk dropping Wayne's monogrammed harmonica after raiding a homestead. That's all the town needs to lynch Wayne. As they say, “We've got incontrovertible proof.”\n\nAnd yet, despite the inanity, or perhaps because of it, the script surprises. When the female lead finds herself surrounded by The Hawk's gang, she isn’t captured. Instead, she displays surprising wit and actually rescues Wayne. It's only _later_ that she’s captured.\n\nAs for Wayne, he's still learning. You catch glimpses of his iconic persona, such as his reaction shots during his sham trial, but they're rare.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"12 Sep 2016","grade":"D","slug":"don-t-breathe-2016","sequence":"57","movie":{"title":"Don't Breathe","runtimeMinutes":88,"originalTitle":"Don't Breathe","year":2016,"directors":[{"fullName":"Fede Alvarez"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"The more I think about _Don't Breathe_, the less I like it.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nThe more I think about _Don't Breathe_, the less I like it.\n\nThe story sees a trio of teens burgle a blind man's dilapidated Detroit home.

It does not.\n\nOnce inside, we’re treated to the film’s lone highlight. The kids' initial encounter with the blind man crackles with palpable tension. I gasped aloud when one character revealed his presence via a creaky floorboard.\n\nThen the plot kicks in, shuffling the characters from one set piece to another with no relatable behavior or convincing motivation. It's lazy writing run amok.\n\nAs time passed, I grew restless. The script ignores the obvious. The man is blind. Grab a hammer, hide behind a door, and brain him. None of the teens try it.\n\nA sense of humor might have saved the movie. But it piles one outlandish plot twist upon another without even a wink toward its own inanity. Even worse, the twists turn downright ugly, proving _Don't Breathe_ would rather push our buttons than tell a compelling story.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"05 Sep 2016","grade":"F","slug":"haunted-gold-1932","sequence":"56","movie":{"title":"Haunted Gold","runtimeMinutes":58,"originalTitle":"Haunted Gold","year":1932,"directors":[{"fullName":"Hugh Harman"},{"fullName":"Rudolf Ising"},{"fullName":"Mack V.

Viola Davis plays Amanda Waller, the puppet-master who sells the project to the Washington brass. The rest of the cast fall somewhere between underwritten and extraneous.\n\n_The Dirty Dozen (1976)_, this ain't. Deadshot won't kill women or children. Harley's just a brat in love with a psycho. _The Bad News Bears (1976)_ had more edge.\n\nEven the Batman cameo disappoints.

Here, he floats down well-lit side streets to tap super-villains on the shoulder.\n\nThe only characters packing genuine menace are Waller and The Joker, neither of whom is on the team.\n\nThe Joker is hardly in the film. Jared Leto mashes up Heath Ledger's intensity in _The Dark Knight (2008)_ with Jack Nicholson's flamboyant camp in _Batman (1989)_. The resulting performance is awful, but at least it holds your attention.\n\nThe rest is forgettable. There's a scene eighty-some-minutes in where the squad rescues Waller. I thought the movie over.

William Holden or Kirk Douglas, maybe. But at 49, Humphrey Bogart looks ridiculous.\n\nThe story opens during World War II with Bogart as an enlisted pilot leading bombing runs and romancing a Red Cross worker played by Eleanor Parker. When he's ordered home, Bogart and Parker try to marry but a series of contrivances thwarts their efforts and Bogart leaves.\n\nCut to present day where more contrivances see a washed-up Bogart land a test pilot job for an aviation mogul played by Raymond Massey. Of course, Parker shows up as Massey’s secretary. She’s dating Massey’s chief engineer, played by Richard Whorf.\n\nConflict arises when Bogart suggests piloting Massey’s experimental fighter jet from Alaska to Washington, D.C. It’s a stunt to convince the Washington brass the plane is ready for production. Whorf opposes the stunt, convinced the jet needs the new safety features he's developing.\n\nMassey wants to produce the fighter now.

The laughable sight of him squeezed into the flight suit distracts from the script’s foresight. Though common enough today, escape pods, pressurized flight suits, and braking parachutes were science fiction to 1950s audiences.\n\nCompounding matters, the film pushes the melodrama, despite the three leads having no chemistry. Will Bogart and Parker get back together? Will there be obstacles to their romance?

The film follows Bulger’s ascent from small-time hood to crime-lord of South Boston. A journey made possible by the FBI.\n\nEarly in the film, the Feds offer Bulger a sweet deal. In exchange for information on the Italian mob in North Boston, the FBI leave Bulger’s crew alone. Even better, they eliminate the competition. Best of all, Bulger’s FBI handler is a South Boston native who idolizes him.\n\nAll the FBI ask is that Bulger not kill anyone.\n\nBut of course, Bulger kills people. He executes one of his lackeys. His gang somehow gets involved in Jai Alai and Bulger orders the commissioner killed. He strangles a young girl who may have talked to the cops.\n\nThis last murder was where the film lost me. It’s late in the film and the script introduces the girl only for Bulger to kill her five minutes later. The scene plays like something out of a horror movie and does nothing to build characterization or advance the plot.\n\nWe also meet Bulger’s younger brother, a state senator played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch is good casting. His Boston accent may be jarring, but he’s believable as Depp’s brother. While both men seem too slight for their parts, they’re convincing as family.\n\nThe film invites comparisons with Scorsese’s _Goodfellas (1990)_ and _The Departed (2006)_, but these comparisons underscore _Black Mass_’s weakness: Bulger isn’t a compelling character.\n\nWe see Bulger build his empire, yet have no idea how he spends a typical day. He makes piles of money but, aside from a pair of cowboy boots, we never see him spend it. He suffers what we’re told are life-changing tragedies, yet seems unfazed.\n\nDepp tries as Bulger, but he can’t compensate for the shallow characterization. He can’t disappear into the character because there is no character, just makeup and an accent.\n\nWith no psychological insight, _Black Mass_ feels hollow.

Not that different, I suppose, from what I expect of the films I review.\n\nBut just as I’m willing to humor a movie that stumbles, provided its intentions are good, I ask you, dear reader, to bear with me.\n\n_The House that Dripped Blood_ comprises four stories revolving around an old English country house. They vary in quality.\n\nThe first story, _Method for Murder_, sees a writer, Charles Hillyer, move into the house along with his wife. Hillyer writes lurid thrillers. He’s certain the house’s creaky atmosphere will help him finish his latest novel. Things take a turn for the macabre when Hillyer sees his literary creation, the murderous strangler Dominic, lurking around the estate.\n\nIt’s a worn premise, but screenwriter Robert Bloch puts a twist on the twist that makes for a satisfying ending.\n\nThe second story, _Waxworks_, follows a retired businessman named Philip Grayson, played by Peter Cushing. While touring a horrific wax museum in town, Grayson notices a figure that bears a striking resemblance to a girl he loved as a young man. Soon, he’s obsessed with the perceived effigy and, as you suspect, it doesn’t end well.\n\nAs with the first installment, you’ll see the twist coming, but Cushing makes it work. Soon to be a widower in real life, Cushing brings a pathos to what’s otherwise a throw-away role.\n\nThe third story, _Sweets to the Sweet_ is the best. Christopher Lee plays John Reid, a widower. The details surrounding his wife’s death are hazy, and Reid doesn’t seem to miss her. He moves into the house with his young daughter, Jane.\n\nUpon arrival the estate agent gives them a tour of the house. When they reach a room with a lit fireplace, Jane runs crying from the fire.\n\nReid hires a tutor for Jane, insisting she not go to school with other children. Astonished Jane has no toys of her own, the tutor buys her a small doll. Outraged, Reid throws the doll into the fire.\n\nThe mystery builds to a satisfying conclusion, with Lee exploiting audience expectations.\n\nThe final story, _The Cloak_, concerns an aging, egotistical horror actor named Paul Henderson. In a flat bit of meta-humor, he dismisses the current generation of horror films, saying he prefers the classics, like Dracula. Although he’s quick to add “The Lugosi one, not this new chap.”\n\nThe plot kicks in when Henderson acquires a cape that belonged to an actual vampire. Wearing it, Henderson sprouts fangs, loses his reflection, and gains the ability to fly.\n\nIt’s played as camp, which is a shame. Co-star Ingrid Pitt, strikes the right balance, but Jon Pertwee’s performance as Henderson never hooked me. The resulting segment fails to thrill or amuse.\n\nAnthology films are hard to grade. My rating averages the individual segments. The third piece’s excellences cancels the fourth’s failed camp. But Christopher Lee’s segment is enough to recommend _The House that Dripped Blood_. After all, if the other stories don’t seem appealing, there’s always the fast-forward button.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"23 Nov 2015","grade":"D+","slug":"and-now-the-screaming-starts-1973","sequence":"50","movie":{"title":"And Now the Screaming Starts!","runtimeMinutes":91,"originalTitle":"And Now the Screaming Starts!","year":1973,"directors":[{"fullName":"Roy Ward Baker"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"The severed hand is surprisingly effective.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nThe severed hand is surprisingly effective.\n\nGory details aside, the story feels familiar.

As with _The House That Dripped Blood (1971)_, the script comes courtesy of Robert Bloch.\n\nThe framing story follows a young doctor named Martin. Martin is interviewing for a position at an asylum for the “incurable insane”. He’s greeted with several surprises. The asylum head, Dr. Starr, has gone insane himself and is now counted amongst the asylum’s patients. Starr’s replacement, Dr. Rutherford, is wheel-chair bound after a patient attack. As if those weren’t enough red flags,  Rutherford makes Martin an unusual offer. Martin can have the job provided he deduces which of the patients is Dr. Starr. Martin protests, but heads upstairs to interview the patients. The bulk of the film illustrates their stories.\n\nThe first story concerns a man who murders his wife, chops up her body, wraps the parts in packing paper, and stores them in a basement freezer. Unfortunately, said wife had a magic bracelet. When the husband tosses the bracelet into the freezer, the body parts spring to life, attacking him and his mistress.\n\nThese types of stories always fail to suspend my disbelief. Not the resurrection part which is creepy with a nice touch where we see a severed head sucking air through the paper wrap. No, the problem lies in the physics of those body parts moving about. Just because they’re reanimated, it doesn’t give them the ability to fly. Yet, how else to explain a severed head climbing a flight of stairs? We see arms and legs lurching about and it looks laughable.\n\nNext we meet Bruno, a former tailor. Broke and facing eviction, Bruno finds salvation in a mysterious gentlemen named Smith. Played by Peter Cushing, Smith offers an extraordinary sum for Bruno to make a suit for Smith’s son. Smith insists Bruno must work according to Smith’s precise specifications. These include oddities such as only working on the suit during the late night and early morning hours. Bruno agrees to Smith’s demands and, a few nights later, arrives on Smith’s doorstep with the suit. To Bruno’s horror, Smith reveals that he has no money to pay. This will prove to be Smith’s smallest surprise.\n\nIn what will become a running theme, the special effects are the story’s undoing. Cushing is great, and the story’s mystery held my attention. But the finale relies on another effect I couldn’t swallow.\n\nThe third entry is more grounded. The story concerns a young woman named Barbara, played by Charlotte Rampling. Barbara is fresh from psychiatric care and under the careful watch of her brother and a nurse. Soon, Barbara’s mischievous friend Lucy shows up. Lucy urges Barbara not to take her medication. Not good for Barbara’s brother and nurse.\n\nThis story is most effective of the lot, but the big reveal will be obvious to anyone with a passing knowledge of the horror genre.\n\nThe last tale involves Dr. Byron, played by Herbert Lom. Byron has perfected soul transference and transfers his essence into a small effigy. The figure resembles a robot as tall as a can of soda with a plastic Herbert Lom head. It looks as ridiculous as it sounds. The stop motion animation reminded me of the Rankin Bass Christmas specials. Despite its appearance, it’s quite deadly, as Dr. Rutherford soon discovers.\n\nWhat to make of this final tale? I can’t imagine anyone finding it frightening. Did director Roy Ward Baker give up and try for camp?\n\nAnd what of _Asylum_ as a whole? Given the talent involved, it’s a let down. Instead of exploiting its able cast, _Asylum_’s script relies on special effects the production can’t deliver. The one time it _does_ lean on its cast, it forces poor Charlotte Rampling through a tired trope. Still, it held my attention, so that’s something.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/a5a2cd56c60d8c1c409442dae593808f/9b7de/asylum-1972.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a5a2cd56c60d8c1c409442dae593808f/eb003/asylum-1972.jpg 200w,\n/static/a5a2cd56c60d8c1c409442dae593808f/11f33/asylum-1972.jpg 400w,\n/static/a5a2cd56c60d8c1c409442dae593808f/9b7de/asylum-1972.jpg 800w,\n/static/a5a2cd56c60d8c1c409442dae593808f/29626/asylum-1972.jpg 1200w,\n/static/a5a2cd56c60d8c1c409442dae593808f/0a886/asylum-1972.jpg 1600w,\n/static/a5a2cd56c60d8c1c409442dae593808f/032f3/asylum-1972.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"21 Sep 2015","grade":"C+","slug":"big-city-blues-1932","sequence":"48","movie":{"title":"Big City Blues","runtimeMinutes":63,"originalTitle":"Big City Blues","year":1932,"directors":[{"fullName":"Mervyn LeRoy"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"I watched _Big City Blues_ because it features an early, uncredited performance from Humphrey Bogart.

Given the film’s obscurity, my expectations were low.\n\nThe story follows Bud, played by Eric Linden. Bud is a young man from Hoopersville, an Indiana town with a population of just eight thousand. Bud’s inherited a small sum and can’t wait to escape small-town life. He buys a train ticket for New York City. Convinced the big city will eat him alive, the station staff wager Bud will return within a month.\n\nUpon arriving, Bud checks into a posh suite at the expensive Hotel Hercules. This at the suggestion of Bud’s only contact in New York, his cousin Gibboney.\n\nCousin Gibboney is a fast-talking piece of work. When Bud says he’s paying eight dollars per day for his suite, Gibboney feigns nonchalance. “Well don’t worry about that,” Gibboney says, “I’ll just have that chopped right in half. I’ll speak to the manager of the hotel, he’s an old pal of mine.” Later, Gibboney explains, “That room was supposed to go for twelve dollars a day, but don’t worry, I spoke to the manager and I fixed it. It’s all right. You can have it for eight.”\n\nGibboney introduces Bud to a couple of chorus girls, including Vida, played by Joan Blondell. Vida and Bud make googly eyes. Gibboney invites the girls to a party in Bud’s suite later that evening.\n\nWith Bud’s money, Gibboney acquires some black market booze. Assorted partiers arrive. Bud and Vida flirt, ignoring the crowd and the hooch. Credit the film for accuracy here, as the crowd goes from jubilant antics to a drunken stupor as the night wears on. As the guest begin to leave, there’s a drunken fight between two men, one played by Bogart. The lights go out. When they come back on, one guest is dead. The remaining partygoers flee, including Vida.\n\nThe police figure Bud for the murder, and issue a warrant for his arrest. Alone and short on funds, Bud reunites with Vida in a speakeasy. He uses the last of his money to gamble, hoping to win enough to secure a future with Vida. Bud wins back his losses and then some, but of course, he doesn’t quit while he’s ahead. Bud loses everything. Then the police pounce.\n\nThe film plays as a cautionary fable, but the pre-code script imbues New York with a certain allure. Part of said allure is Blondell as Vida. She’s all wholesome charm tinged with a bad-girl streak. Like a spiked milkshake. Before gambling away his money, Bud wonders if they should just leave. Vida replies, “I don’t wanna leave. I wanna stay where there’s noise and excitement and crowds!” Judging by Bud’s reaction, this is just the response he wanted.\n\nLinden plays Bud as naive without being cloying. The script helps. In a lesser film, Bud would be judgmental. Here, he doesn’t object to the bootleg gin and he knows his way around a dice game.\n\nThis isn’t a great film, but it’s not a bad one either. It held my interest and even offered a chuckle or two via Gibboney’s rapid-fire dialog. I may have watched _Big City Blues_ for Bogart, but I enjoyed more than just his small role.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"19 Sep 2015","grade":"C+","slug":"the-whip-and-the-body-1963","sequence":"47","movie":{"title":"The Whip and the Body","runtimeMinutes":91,"originalTitle":"La frusta e il corpo","year":1963,"directors":[{"fullName":"Mario Bava"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"Any film starring Christopher Lee as a ghost whipping a half-nude woman as she moans in ecstasy can’t be all bad.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nAny film starring Christopher Lee as a ghost whipping a half-nude woman as she moans in ecstasy can’t be all bad.\n\n_The Whip and The Body_ opens with Lee on horseback approaching a large ocean front castle. He plays Kurt, a young nobleman returning to his ancestral castle after some time away.\n\nWe learn Kurt has something of a notorious reputation and the castle is full of people wishing to do him harm. Soon Kurt is dead under mysterious circumstances, and his ghost is stalking the castle, claiming those who might have killed him.\n\nThere’s also Nevenka, once Kurt’s fiancée, now married to his younger brother. She claims to hate Kurt, but her reactions to his whip say otherwise.\n\nEvery frame in _The Whip and The Body_ drips gothic atmosphere. The castle interiors are all blue-green hues mixed with inky shadows across stone walls and floors. Think of the old Universal Monster sets brought to glorious technicolor life.\n\nBut where those pictures may have hinted or implied sexual overtones, _The Whip and the Body_ is overt. Kurt flogs Nevenka and she likes it. By injecting a liberal dose of sex and violence, the film rejuvenates the haunted castle story.\n\nThe film’s only misstep lies in it’s overbearing, generic score. It sounds like something out of a soap opera, not the eerie, haunting soundtrack the film deserves.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"18 Sep 2015","grade":"D+","slug":"i-monster-1971","sequence":"46","movie":{"title":"I, Monster","runtimeMinutes":75,"originalTitle":"I, Monster","year":1971,"directors":[{"fullName":"Stephen Weeks"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"“He would be the most dangerous human being on earth. A monster.”","rawMarkdownBody":"\n“He would be the most dangerous human being on earth. A monster.”\n\nThat’s how a learned doctor describes the titular character in _I, Monster_. Unfortunately, the script, from Robert Louis Stevenson’s _Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde_, doesn’t live up to its own hype.\n\nChristopher Lee, sporting an unwieldy hairpiece, plays Marlowe, a psychiatrist in early 20th century England exploring Freud’s theories of the id, ego and super-ego. Marlowe invents a drug that removes the ego and super-ego, leaving only the primal id.\n\nWell, mostly. At first, the subjects turn primal. Violent, lusty, or terrified. But later, the titular character shows signs of an ego, formulating long term plans and deferring gratification. I’m not sure we’re meant to notice this behavior.\n\nAnyway. After dosing his cat, and a few of his patients, Marlowe begins experimenting on himself. This brings forth the contemptible Mr. Blake. Marlowe’s transformation is physical as well as mental. The more corrupt and immoral Blake becomes, the more hideous Blake’s visage. It’s not clear how this relates to Freud’s theories.\n\nIn time, Marlow’s friend and solicitor Mr. Utterson, played by Peter Cushing, comes to believe Blake is blackmailing Marlowe. Seeking to aid his friend, Utterson investigates Blake, and begins to suspect the unthinkable truth.\n\n_I, Monster_ disappoints given its two leads. Lee is magnetic during his transformation scenes, and repulsive yet captivating as Blake. Cushing’s character is little more than a plot device, but he’s still fun to watch. A Jekyll and Hyde story featuring these two shouldn’t be so forgettable.\n\nWhere the film shines is in its art direction. Marlowe’s laboratory has a cluttered, lived-in feel that lends atmosphere while avoiding the usual mad scientist tropes. His club sees cultured, well-dressed gentlemen sipping whiskey in overstuffed chairs while discussing professional and philosophical issues. I could almost smell the leather and tobacco.\n\nYet, the film doesn’t work. Even at a scant 75 minutes, _I, Monster_ is too long. There’s just not enough story to sustain a feature length film. Having Marlow inject the serum instead of gulping a potion is a nice touch, but the script doesn’t run with the addiction metaphor.\n\nInstead, we see characters walking down hallways, walking across rooms, and going up and down stairs. Lots of extraneous shots that add nothing, but seem necessary to pad the running time. Perhaps these bits were part of the abandoned attempt to utilize the Pulfrich effect for 3-D.\n\nRegardless, one could drop fifteen minutes and have a solid film, but then it wouldn’t be a feature. The studio, Amicus, is best known for their horror anthologies. Films like _Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors (1965)_, _Torture Garden (1967)_, _The House That Dripped Blood (1971)_, _Tales from the Crypt (1972)_, _Asylum (1972)_, _Vault of Horror (1973)_ and _From Beyond the Grave (1974)_. Perhaps they would have done better by shortening _I, Monster_ and using it in one of them instead.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"05 Sep 2015","grade":"C+","slug":"two-evil-eyes-1990","sequence":"45","movie":{"title":"Two Evil Eyes","runtimeMinutes":120,"originalTitle":"Due occhi diabolici","year":1990,"directors":[{"fullName":"Dario Argento"},{"fullName":"George A. Romero"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"Skip the first half of _Two Evil Eyes_. Or at least watch the second half first.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nSkip the first half of _Two Evil Eyes_. Or at least watch the second half first.\n\nThe film comprises two hour-long segments based on the works of Edgar Allen Poe. The first, directed by George Romero, adapts _The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar_. The second, directed by Dario Argento, loosely adapts _The Black Cat_.\n\n_The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar_ stars Adrienne Barbeau as Jessica, a woman embezzling her elderly husband’s fortune. Her former lover, Dr. Hoffman, hypnotizes the ailing Ernest Valdemar under the guise of easing his pain. Hoffman then orders the hypnotized Valdemar to sign his assets over to Jessica, who liquidates them.\n\nAll goes according to plan until Valdemar dies while under hypnosis. Trapped in a hypnotic state, Valdemar’s soul cannot cross over to the land of the dead.\n\nSoon, Valdemar’s frozen corpse is stalking the two conspirators, shambling around calling Jessica’s name. He does this without moving his mouth, which was a problem for me, but I’ll get to that later.\n\nRomero’s segment has a made-for-TV feel. I can’t identify the exact cause. Perhaps it’s the under-written characters, or the under-furnished sets. Or the flat lighting. Maybe it’s the stiff performances. Or the EC Comics style twist ending. Whatever the reason, Romero’s film could pass for a lost episode of _Tales From the Crypt_.\n\nThat’s not necessarily a bad thing. I loved that show. But, fair or not, one expects more from a feature film.\n\nAstute viewers will notice a problem with Ramy Zada as Dr. Hoffman. The script tells us he and Jessica were lovers before she married Valdemar, back when she worked as a stewardess. But Zada’s thirteen years younger than Barbeau. Assuming Barbeau was in her early twenties during their affair, that puts Zada at ten years old.\n\nBut I can get past that.\n\nWhat I couldn’t get past was Valdemar’s ventriloquist act. I couldn’t buy hearing his voice without seeing his mouth move. Romero may have been trying to stay faithful to the source material, but the result feels like what it is: a dubbed-in effect. Worse, it feels unintentional. As though they added it as an afterthought, or because they couldn’t get the prosthetics working right on-set.\n\nRomero’s script has something to say about greed, but his segment lacks the focus and visceral punch of his better work. The story drags and the ending feels obligatory instead of shocking.\n\nArgento’s entry, _The Black Cat_ stars Harvey Keitel as Rod (short for Roderick) Usher, a tabloid photographer. We meet him at a crime scene. A woman lies naked on a table, cleaved in half at the waist. Rod snaps pictures of the lurid spectacle while chatting with the detectives investigating the crime. Poking around, he releases a large pendulum blade. We get a dynamic POV shot as the blade arcs down with a roar and embeds itself between the corpse’s halves.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Rod descends into madness culminating in murder. There are some supernatural elements, including the persistent titular feline, but they’re presented as possible figments of Rod’s imagination.\n\nArgento piles on the Poe references en route to a Grand Guignol conclusion that’s so over-the-top it’ll make you laugh and gag in the same breath.\n\nFinal reveal aside, the film balances atmosphere and gore. Rod’s brownstone has a worn, lived-in feel. The narrow, shadow-filled rooms engender feelings of confinement. The city streets, feelings of isolation and anonymity. The gruesome murders Rod photographs are both inspired by Poe tales. Besides the halved corpse that opens the film, we see one with its mouth wired open after having its teeth pried out.\n\nArgento’s only outright misstep is Keitel’s wardrobe. Harvey’s a great actor and a good choice, but he should never, ever, wear a beret.\n\nHow to rate the film? _Two Evil Eyes_ is uneven. Romero’s entry rates two stars, while Argento’s rates four. I split the difference.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"29 Aug 2015","grade":"D+","slug":"shock-waves-1977","sequence":"44","movie":{"title":"Shock Waves","runtimeMinutes":85,"originalTitle":"Shock Waves","year":1977,"directors":[{"fullName":"Ken Wiederhorn"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"The four survivors planned to hole up in the abandoned hotel’s vault-like refrigerator.

It was a good plan, considering the squad of undead, water-breathing Nazi storm troopers lurking outside. Then one survivor gets claustrophobic and fires a signal flare into the refrigerator. That’s where _Shock Waves_ lost me.\n\nThe film had potential. Early on, John Carradine captains a small sight-seeing boat. On board are his mate, the chef, and four tourists. Carradine holds our interest while the script forces a series of contrived events to strand the boat on a remote island. The most ridiculous of which sees him throw the ship’s navigation system overboard.\n\nAt least the island locations look great. The characters trudge through overgrown marshes and watery bogs to discover a crumbling hotel. The filmmakers struck gold here, shooting in an abandoned Biltmore. Its decrepit luxury oozes atmosphere.\n\nBut the script’s inanity is taxing. Moving through the hotel, the group discovers an aquarium teaming with exotic fish. Yet, moments later, they seem surprised to find the hotel occupied.\n\nPeter Cushing plays the hotel’s lone resident, a morose Nazi living in self-imposed exile. He warns the group to leave the island, even telling them where they can find a boat. Do they listen? Of course not.\n\nBoth Cushing and Carradine have roles so minor they’re window dressing, but they’re the best parts of the film.\n\nSoon, undead Nazis are picking off the stranded visitors. They get a lot of help from the script. A veteran sailor impales his foot on a sea urchin after tromping barefoot through a murky inland stream. Later, five grown men and women lose a sailboat, their only chance at escape, in knee-deep water. After that, the group scatters and one man decides to flee alone down a waist-deep stream.\n\nThe Nazis themselves are a nameless, nondescript unit of waterlogged storm troopers. We see them rising from the ocean depths, their expressionless faces clad with black goggles. It’s a memorable visual. In part because the film repeats it over and over. Nazis walk into the water. Nazis walk out of the water. Nazis sit up in shallow bogs of water like vampires rising from a coffin.\n\nWhich brings us back to where _Shock Waves_ lost me. The four survivors are safe, locked in the hotel’s vault-like fridge. One becomes claustrophobic. He demands to leave. Knowing certain death lurks outside, the others say no. The claustrophobic man becomes enraged. He fires a flare gun into the fridge then flees into the zombie-infested night. The signal flare fills the fridge with smoke and blinds a woman. Rather than allow the smoke to clear, the two other survivors also flee, abandoning the blinded one.\n\nThe characters in _Shock Waves_ are so inane, by the end, we’re rooting against them. We can’t connect with them because they don’t behave like human beings. They act like idiots.\n\nThis alone isn’t a bad thing. One vicarious thrill of horror movies lies in seeing such foolish behavior punished.\n\nBut _Shock Waves_ disappoints. When claustrophobia guy jeopardizes the lives of everyone with his selfish behavior, we expect to see him offed in spectacular fashion. But his demise consists of a zombie pulling him underwater.\n\nIt’s a shame. Even on an exploitation level, the film doesn’t deliver. The ripe premise, solid production and entertaining turns from Cushing and Carradine deserved better.","backdrop":null}}]},"more":{"nodes":[{"grade":"C+","slug":"maniac-cop-1988","sequence":"43","markdown":{"backdrop":null},"movie":{"title":"Maniac Cop"}},{"grade":"B","slug":"hell-is-for-heroes-1962","sequence":"42","markdown":{"backdrop":null},"movie":{"title":"Hell Is for Heroes"}},{"grade":"C","slug":"inside-out-2015","sequence":"41","markdown":{"backdrop":null},"movie":{"title":"Inside Out"}},{"grade":"A-","slug":"the-searchers-1956","sequence":"40","markdown":{"backdrop":null},"movie":{"title":"The Searchers"}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":20,"skip":40,"numPages":6,"currentPage":3,"moreSkip":60,"moreLimit":4}}}
