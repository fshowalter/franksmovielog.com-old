Not the bustling metropolis of today, but the seedy, dangerous cesspool Hollywood liked to conjure during the 70s and 80s. A vicious jungle where street punks, pimps, and pushers lurked around every darkened corner. The film embraces this atmosphere. Everything feels worn, lived-in, and used.\n\nThe story concerns a series of killings perpetrated by a uniformed police officer. The victims aren’t criminals, but random innocent people. The killer frames young beat cop Jack Forrest (Bruce Campbell) for the murders. Grizzled detective Frank McCrae (Tom Atkins) doesn’t buy it.\n\nAlong with Jack’s cop girlfriend, McCrae tracks the killings to former cop Matt Cordell. Cordell was a legend on the force.  A super-cop whose shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later mentality landed him on the wrong side of the law. The only trouble? Cordell died in prison.\n\nOr did he? There’s no explicit supernatural element, but Cordell’s resilience is superhuman. Think Michael Myers from the _Halloween_ franchise. Though one wonders about the scars lacing his face. He recovers from a prison assault that saw him stabbed to a bloody pulp, but a few slashes to the face are a bridge too far? Does his body draw the line at cosmetic wounds?\n\nJack soon realizes Cordell is out to kill the mayor and police commissioner. The film feints staging this during the city’s St. Patrick’s Day parade spectacle, but betrays its budget by engineering a car chase to an abandoned warehouse.\n\nAt least it’s an entertaining car chase. The POV shots are reminiscent of Campbell’s friend, director Sam Raimi, who turns up as a newsman introducing the parade.\n\nDespite its meager budget, _Maniac Cop_ is a lot of fun. Perhaps it’s the cast. Campbell never takes himself too seriously, always acting as if he were impersonating a B-movie actor. And Atkins has made a career out of playing the same grizzled, hard-drinking cop. He delivers a conscious, but not condescending, stereotype. Just because the performance is familiar, doesn’t mean it’s any less welcome. Atkins plays McCrae with the perfect amount of gravitas.  His reaction during the scene where Richard Roundtree, as the police commissioner, tells him “You don’t smile very much,” made me laugh out loud.\n\nAlong those lines, director William Lustig injects a streak of black comedy. Consider the scene where Cordell asphyxiates a man in a block of wet concrete. Lustig smash cuts to the following morning as jackhammers work to extract the face-down corpse.\n\nThat said, _Maniac Cop_ is not perfect. Cordell’s big reveal is something of a letdown. Robert Z’Dar is fine, but I couldn’t help thinking of Brian Thompson. The bigger problem is Jack’s girlfriend. Despite being a vice cop, she acts like a teenage girl, shrieking at every development. Not what you’d expect from a trained officer familiar with life-threatening situations. I don’t fault actress Laurene Landon. She’s convincing in some scenes and ridiculous in others. This falls on Lustig.\n\nStill, _Maniac Cop_ is that rarest of B-movies, one made by folks who seem to enjoy the work. Like most horror films of that era, _Maniac Cop_ got a sequel. Unlike most, this one deserved it.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"15 Jul 2015","grade":"B","slug":"hell-is-for-heroes-1962","sequence":"42","movie":{"title":"Hell Is for Heroes","runtimeMinutes":90,"originalTitle":"Hell Is for Heroes","year":1962,"directors":[{"fullName":"Don Siegel"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Hell Is for Heroes_ tells the story of a small squad of American soldiers.

It’s 1944 and the group has seen its share of action on the European lines. Now, they’re enjoying a break in a bombed-out village near the Siegfried Line.\n\nPrivate John Reese, played by Steve McQueen, arrives with orders to join the squad. Reese, a former master sergeant demoted to private for insubordination, wastes little time alienating himself from the rest of the men. Rumors swirl that the squad’s next orders will send them home. The men are giddy. Reese is forlorn. The war has become his life. Later that night, he disobeys orders and heads into town for a drink.\n\nBut, of course, the squad doesn’t go home. Orders come through sending them back to the line. Reese brightens. On the line, he’s calm but vigilant. An exemplary soldier. Good thing, because the existing American forces soon withdraw, leaving the squad horribly outnumbered. The men rig up a series of schemes to project an illusion of strength, but the Germans soon discover the truth.\n\nKnowing the undermanned squad can’t withstand the inevitable German assult, Reese pushes for an attack on a German pillbox across the line. This would force the Germans into a defensive position, giving the squad a fighting chance. Reese gets orders to stay put while the acting officer leaves to notify command. Reese disregards these orders and convinces two other squad members to join him in a stealth raid. Acting without orders, the men make their way across the mine-leaden no-man’s land with disastrous results.\n\nGiven its troubled production, the film should have been a disaster. Robert Pirosh wrote the script and planned to produce and direct. Once McQueen came aboard, the two clashed over script changes. McQueen wanted the other men’s roles diminished and his beefed up. McQueen got his way and Pirosh walked. The studio installed Don Siegel as director. McQueen’s antics had already alienated him from most of the cast, and he clashed with Siegel and the studio as production went on.\n\nAnd yet, the film works. Unlike the heroic melodrama typical of the genre, _Hell Is for Heroes_ features a dark, nihilistic undercurrent. During one of the film’s most powerful scenes, a soldier screams “MY GUTS!” while clutching his stomach after getting shot. The performance is gripping. The screams go on. Pain gives way to panic. Mania creeps into the soldier’s voice. It would be painful to watch if there were actual blood. But instead we’re given bloodless wounds and carnage-free explosions.\n\nTo this end, _Hell Is for Heroes_ looks like a B-movie. The sweltering northern California woods can only suggest the muddy forests of Germany. During firefights, men stiffen up and fall over to simulate getting shot. Before the climatic battle, we’re shown low-quality stock footage of artillery firing.\n\nBut McQueen’s performance transcends the shoddy production. He doesn’t say much. Instead, he uses his eyes and body language to show us Reese’s feelings. It’s a riveting turn that’s equal parts cold detachment and tumultuous emotion. Watching the film, one is hard pressed to disagree with McQueen’s insistence that the script focus on him. He carries the film.\n\nThe only performer who comes close to matching McQueen is James Coburn. Coburn plays Henshaw, a habitual tinkerer struggling with the destruction inherit in war. His defining scene sees him manning a flame-thrower, fighting back manic laughter as he incinerates a group of trapped German soldiers. It’s a haunting visage that foreshadows the star Coburn would later become.\n\nGranted, not all the performances are winners. Nick Adams overplays his part as a Polish refugee. His scenes bleed into melodrama. And Bob Newhart looks lost doing a variation of his standup shtick. But the film overcomes these stumbles to finish strong.\n\nAccording to multiple accounts, the finale was an accident. The production simply ran out of money and couldn’t shoot any more footage. Yet, it’s the perfect, morally ambiguous, ending to punctuate the film’s madness-of-war message. The men charge forward as the camera zooms in. The war goes on, even as the film comes to an end. The flimsy production and awkward comedy fade in our memory as we’re left to ponder the significance of a single pillbox and all the lives it cost.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"11 Jul 2015","grade":"C","slug":"inside-out-2015","sequence":"41","movie":{"title":"Inside Out","runtimeMinutes":95,"originalTitle":"Inside Out","year":2015,"directors":[{"fullName":"Ronnie Del Carmen"},{"fullName":"Pete Docter"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Inside Out_ is an ambitious animated feature that opens inside the mind of a newborn girl named Riley.

There, we meet our protagonist Joy, an anthropomorphic emotion. In voicing Joy, Amy Poehler manages the near-impossible feat of being relentlessly optimistic and perky without ever being annoying.\n\nSoon, Riley’s other core emotions—Disgust, Fear, Anger and Sadness—appear. The group operates out of Headquarters, a Space Needle shaped building at the center of Riley’s consciousness. Using a pastel-infused command-console that looks equal parts Playskool and Apple, they influence Riley’s behavior.\n\nEarly on, Joy dominates. Disgust, Fear, and Anger provide comic relief. Riley grows from infant to toddler to pre-teen. Outside Headquarters, islands akin to giant amusement parks spring to life. These represent Riley’s personality. They grow as new happy memories are formed.\n\nIt’s an efficient opening act with one misstep. Sadness is frustrating. Her actions feel plot-driven and, compared to Joy, her character arc is shallow.\n\nThe plot kicks in when Riley, now age 11, finds herself uprooted by a move to San Fransisco. At first, Joy coaxes Riley to remain positive. But a dilapidated house, frazzled parents, a new school, and a moving van that seems to circumnavigate the globe en-route to San Francisco, take their toll.\n\nThings get even worse when Joy and Sadness find themselves stranded far from Headquarters. This renders Riley unable to feel either of their respective emotions.\n\nNow, the film shifts to adventure as Joy struggles to get them back to Headquarters. On the way, the pair wander through Riley’s long-term memories and meet her almost-forgotten imaginary friend, Bing Bong.\n\nMeanwhile, Riley, unable to feel anything but anger, fear and disgust, begins lashing out at her parents and friends. As she does, the islands of her personality crumble and fall away into nothingness.\n\nAs Joy’s desperation to reach Headquarters grows, she and Sadness induce a nightmare involving a giant clown. It’s a sequence that will give a fair number of viewers nightmares of their own.\n\nSoon after, the film offers a scene of unexpected depth. Joy and Bing Bong find themselves in a desolate dumping-ground where memories dissolve into dust. We see images of young Riley laughing and playing with Bing Bong. As these memories dissolve and blow away, Bing Bong himself fades from existence. He accepts his fate with a quiet dignity that belies his goofy exterior. It’s a poignant moment that forces older viewers to acknowledge the loss of innocence inherit in growing up[^1].\n\nIt’s this willingness to tackle complex themes without patronizing the audience that makes _Inside Out_ an impressive film. Odds are, you’ll think it a wonderful movie. I did.\n\nWell, almost.\n\nTo explain my objection, I must discuss the ending. Spoiler alert.\n\nStill here? Okay.\n\nThe film climaxes with Riley, finally able to feel her emotions, crying and hugging her parents. As she does, the missing islands of her personality spring back into existence. Cut to a short time later. Riley is back to her old self.\n\nFor a film that felt so honest in its depiction of the human condition, this felt disingenuous. For all the drama of the islands of personality crumbling into the void, a simple hug reconstructs them exactly as they were?\n\nWhere are the consequences?\n\nThis was a chance to show Riley adjusting to the move, but at a cost. Maybe part of her never comes back. Maybe the relationship with her parents is forever altered. Maybe when that island returns it’s different, maybe smaller. Anything but the saccharine, everything’s okay bit of fluff we’re given. Sure, new memories are now mixes of emotions instead of pure joy, but this is peddled as a wholly positive change. Where’s the trade-off?\n\n_Inside Out_ drives home the message that growing up means accepting sadness as a part of life, yet it can’t apply that lesson to its own ending.\n\n[^1]: Saddest Disney scene I can remember. Seriously, Bambi’s mom has nothing on this.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"20 Jun 2015","grade":"A-","slug":"the-searchers-1956","sequence":"40","movie":{"title":"The Searchers","runtimeMinutes":119,"originalTitle":"The Searchers","year":1956,"directors":[{"fullName":"John Ford"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_The Searchers_ is a very good film about a very flawed man.","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_The Searchers_ is a very good film about a very flawed man.\n\nThe story opens three years after the Civil War.  John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate soldier turned drifter who visits his brother’s family on the Texas frontier.\n\nShortly after Ethan arrives, Comanches massacre his brother and sister-in-law. After the funeral, Ethan sets off in search of his young niece Debbie, whom the Comanche have taken captive. Accompanying Ethan is Martin Pawley, an orphan Ethan’s brother and sister-in-law raised as their own.\n\nIt’s a daunting task. Director John Ford uses the gigantic mesas of Monument Valley to frame his characters as tiny and alone. Small specs on the vast, unforgiving landscape of the frontier.\n\nAs the years pass, Ethan’s hatred for the Comanche consumes him. Martin realizes with growing horror that Ethan means to kill Debbie should they find her. Such is Ethan’s unbridled hate for the Comanche, that he can’t bear the thought of her having gone native.\n\nThe film isn’t all dark. During breaks when the trail goes cold, Ethan and Martin return to a neighboring homestead. There, Martin and a young pioneer girl fumble at flirtation in a series of slapstick events. These bits can be jarring, but they exist to lighten the mood. Without them, the ending would feel disingenuous.\n\nPutting aside these comedic interludes, this is Wayne’s movie. He gives a fearless performance. Consider the scene where he meets Martin. While he’s all smiles around his family, when he sees Martin he goes cold. Martin is one-eighth Comanche. In a glance, Ethan identifies him as ‘the other’ and his bitterness bubbles to the surface. In Ethan, Wayne inhabits a disenfranchised, angry man. After battling on the losing side of a war, he longs for validation. In the Comanche he finds an outlet for his rage. Another war to fight. A chance to redeem himself.\n\nBut of course, he’s beyond redemption. The now-famous closing shot illustrates this perfectly. As everyone enters the house, Ethan remains outside. He shifts his weight, watching the joy inside. In his eyes, we see a longing battling the unease. He turns and walks back toward the frontier alone.\n\nIt’s this refusal to judge or redeem Wayne’s character that makes _The Searchers_ resonate. Ethan has moments of compassion and heroism, but the film doesn’t allow for a contrived finale that sees him cured of his bigotry. Nor does it paint him as a one-dimensional villain incapable of recognizing his own shortcomings. Instead, we’re left to acknowledge Ethan’s nature and contemplate the role men like him played in the settling of the American West.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"13 Jun 2015","grade":"B","slug":"the-city-of-the-dead-1960","sequence":"39","movie":{"title":"The City of the Dead","runtimeMinutes":78,"originalTitle":"The City of the Dead","year":1960,"directors":[{"fullName":"John Llewellyn Moxey"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_The City of the Dead_ opens in a small, fog-shrouded village.

The locals have gathered to burn Elizabeth Selwyn for the crime of witchcraft.[^1] As the flames consume her, Elizabeth pledges her soul to Lucifer in exchange for eternal life. The bloodthirsty villagers drown her out, chanting “Burn witch, burn!”\n\nSmash-cut to an extreme close-up of Christopher Lee repeating the same line. It's present day. Lee plays Alan Driscoll, a college professor lecturing a group of young students on the history of witchcraft. In attendance are our heroine, Nan, and her boyfriend Bill. Nan sits in rapt attention, shushing Bill's snide comments. It's clear Bill took the course just to hit on Nan. It's less clear what she sees in him.[^2]\n\nAfter the lecture, Nan approaches Professor Driscoll. Nan wants to use her upcoming winter break to write a thesis on witchcraft in New England, but feels she needs some first-hand research. She plans to get a room in the smallest, oldest town in New England she can find. There she’ll comb through the town hall records, recheck the libraries, and interview the puritan descendants. Impressed by her enthusiasm, Driscoll suggests she visit his hometown, a small New England village called Whitewood. Nan agrees.\n\nBill, who’d hoped Nan would spend the break with him, tries to dissuade her, but Nan remains resolute.\n\nBefore long, Nan’s pulling up to a desolate filling station in the dead of night asking for directions to Whitewood. The station attendant tries to warn her away, but Nan dismisses his concern. Armed with directions, she heads out into the fog-covered night.\n\nOutside of town, Nan picks up a hitchhiker, played by Valentine Dyall. Dyall’s performance is all ominous menace. When he speaks, it’s as though someone is talking _through_ him.\n\nWhen Nan finally arrives in Whitewood, we recognize it from the opening sequence. The town drips atmosphere, from the fog-laced streets to the dark, claustrophobic interiors. Nan turns to her passenger who, of course, has vanished.\n\nNan checks into the local inn. The proprietor bears an uncanny resemblance to Elizabeth Selwyn.\n\nCan you see where this is going?\n\nBefore I venture any further, let me say that the DVD from VCI is under $10 on Amazon. It’s the only way to watch the film. There's a print streaming on Amazon Prime and I’ve seen a few others floating around on YouTube, but they’re all cropped, scratchy or low resolution. Spend the $9 and change and watch it on a decent up-converting DVD player. It’s worth it.\n\nBack to the review. At this point, those weary of spoilers should stop reading as I must cover a few plot points to illustrate why the film is so good.\n\nYou see, despite setting up a predictable plot where Nan gets captured by Elizabeth and rescued by her boyfriend, the film takes a darker turn. The witches of Whitewood lure Nan into the tunnels beneath the inn. They snatch her and drag her screaming into a hidden chamber. They place her on a sacrificial altar, holding her down as she kicks and thrashes. A black robed figure raises a knife over her chest. Nan screams. The knife drives toward her chest as we smash-cut to a knife plunging into a cake.\n\nNan is dead.\n\nIt’s quite a narrative surprise, considering she’d been our lone protagonist. Now it’s Nan’s brother, Bob, and Bill who retrace her steps and confront the evil lurking in the village.\n\nAnd remember Professor Driscoll? It’s hinted early that he might be up to no good, but after Nan meets her fate, there’s no doubt left. Driscoll is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, searching for victims to sustain his cursed brethren. Lee plays him with a perfect mix of cultured charm and seething menace.\n\nIndeed, Lee's performance, like the film, is an overlooked gem. While critics laud Lee's early work for Hammer productions, this entry by Hammer rival Amicus[^3] remains forgotten. It’s a shame, especially considering this film’s combination of contemporary setting and satanic themes foreshadowed the cinematic horror trends that proved to be Hammer’s undoing.[^4]\n\nTo that end, one could say _The City of the Dead_ was ahead of its time. That elements like the filling station attendant attempting to warn the unsuspecting strangers, or the red-herring protagonist, have been copied by so many other films they're now regarded as tropes. But I’ll leave the academia to others. Suffice it to say the film _works_.\n\n[^1]: A likely inspiration for the witch burning skit in _Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)_.\n\n[^2]: According to [the article on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_of_the_Dead_(film)), producer Milton Subotsky added the character of Bill when he rewrote George Baxt’s script.\n\n[^3]: Then called Vulcan Pictures.\n\n[^4]: Hammer wouldn’t produce a contemporary satanic-themed horror film until _To the Devil a Daughter (1976)_, their final film. Meanwhile, films like _Rosemary’s Baby (1968)_ and _The Exorcist (1973)_ made millions at the box office.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"18 Apr 2015","grade":"B","slug":"wolfcop-2014","sequence":"38","movie":{"title":"WolfCop","runtimeMinutes":79,"originalTitle":"WolfCop","year":2014,"directors":[{"fullName":"Lowell Dean"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_WolfCop_ is about an alcoholic sheriff’s deputy who becomes a werewolf and uses his newfound powers to clean up his small town.

It’s ridiculous in the best possible way.\n\nThey don’t make movies like this anymore. Nowadays, B movies are homogenized, euphemistic, schlock neutered for release on basic cable. The manic energy is gone, along with any sense of pride from the people involved. Instead, we get half-assed camp with D-list performers that can’t disguise their contempt for the material.\n\nTo that end, _WolfCop_ is a rarity. A lurid pulp creation made by talented folks who seem to be enjoying themselves. You can feel it in every over-the-top minute.\n\nConsider the transformation scene. A genre staple. Our protagonist, Lou, stumbles drunk into a dive bar bathroom. The change begins as he relieves himself. Lou lets out a howl. His urine turns blood red as his penis sprouts hair and inflates like a trick balloon.\n\nIt’s a crazy shot, but not gratuitous. In leading with the genitals, WolfCop conveys the character’s transformation pain better than any werewolf film I can recall. I laughed and cringed in the same breath.\n\nNot every scene is as calculated. Scenes like WolfCop tricking out his police cruiser, or foiling a gang of graffiti artists by hosing them down with his urine, are just silly. But that’s okay. The film’s only pushing the werewolf genre tropes to their natural extremes.\n\nIn _WolfCop_, it’s not “What if a cop became a werewolf?” It’s “What if a drunken cop stereotype became a werewolf super cop?” The resulting mishmash of cop drama and supernatural horror is a tone-perfect, greasy hamburger of a movie that clocks in at a scant seventy nine minutes.\n\nBut let’s face it, the bit about the ballooning penis already told you everything you needed to know, didn’t it?","backdrop":null}},{"date":"11 Apr 2015","grade":"D","slug":"it-follows-2014","sequence":"37","movie":{"title":"It Follows","runtimeMinutes":100,"originalTitle":"It Follows","year":2014,"directors":[{"fullName":"David Robert Mitchell"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_It Follows_ is the perfect white-bread horror film for folks who dismiss the genre as a step or two above pornography.

It's well-produced, self-aware, and devoid of any disturbing scares or gratuitous thrills.\n\nThe story opens at dusk. A girl half-dressed (but not nude) in high heels flees her suburban home. She runs into the street. Her wide eyes darting back over her shoulder. She pauses, then runs back toward her house. Her father steps outside and asks if she's okay. She says she is as she runs back inside. A moment later, she's back out. She gets into her car, backs out of the driveway, and speeds off into the darkness.\n\nShe stops at a lake and walks down to the water. She sits down with the water at her back and makes a tearful call to her parents. She apologizes for past transgressions and says she loves them.\n\nCut to the morning. The girl lies dead on the beach, her body twisted in a grotesque angle.\n\nNext, we meet our protagonist, Jay. She's a nice girl, living in suburban Detroit. She's got a younger sister, and a couple of other friends that make up her social circle. She's been dating a guy named Hugh that she's pretty sweet on.\n\nJay and Hugh go to the movies[^1], but leave when Hugh catches sight of a woman in a yellow dress. Jay doesn't see her, but a shaken Hugh insists they leave.\n\nLater that night, Jay has sex with Hugh in the backseat of his car. It's their first time together. Afterwards, Jay lies in the backseat talking to Hugh while he fumbles around in the trunk. He finds what he's looking for and climbs back into the car behind her. Hugh cuts Jay off mid-sentence by covering her mouth with a rag. Jay struggles, but soon passes out.\n\nJay wakes up tied to a wheelchair in a desolate, graffiti-covered parking garage. Hugh paces behind her, his eyes darting around. \"You're not going to believe me,\" he begins, \"but I need to you to remember what I'm saying.\"\n\nHugh tells Jay something is now following her. It doesn't run, but it's always walking in a straight line towards her. If it touches her, she's dead. It can look like anyone. Someone she knows or a complete stranger. It's a curse. Someone gave it to him, and now, by having sex with her, he's given it to her. If the thing gets her, it goes after him again, then right down the line to wherever it started. The best thing she can do now, he says, is to have sex with someone else and pass on the curse.\n\nTo prove his point, Hugh wheels Jay to the edge of the garage. In the overgrown lot below, a half-naked woman shambles toward them. Hugh waits until the thing is almost on top of them before wheeling Jay to his car. They peel out, leaving the thing behind. Hugh dumps Jay on her front lawn, still half-dressed, where her sister and friends find her.\n\nThe thing soon comes for Jay at her house. It turns out to be invisible to those not cursed, so her friends are little help as an early warning system. Jay flees to a park.\n\nFrom there, Jay and her friends retreat to a neighbor's lake house. The next day, the thing catches up with them. Despite being invisible, the thing manhandles Jay's friends when they try to stop it.\n\nOnce again, Jay flees. The film breaks the narrative circle by having Jay crash her car in a cornfield. It's the same tired trope of the girl tripping while fleeing the monster. She wakes up in a hospital. Realizing she's in danger, but too injured to leave, Jay has sex with her neighbor, passing the curse. The neighbor turns out to be pretty dim-witted. The thing gets him in a matter of days. Jay flees again and ends up passing the curse to a pair of random strangers.\n\nThe strangers don't last long. It’s likely Jay never warned them, but perhaps she tried and they didn’t believe her. Either way, it's soon back after Jay, but this time her friends have a plan.\n\nThey go to the local indoor pool, where Jay wades into the center of the water[^2]. After some tense waiting, the thing shows up, but refuses to enter the water. Instead, it throws things at Jay. One of her friends produces a handgun. He fires blind at where the creature might be. He wings another of Jay's friends before putting a bullet in the creature's head. The thing falls into the pool and dies trying to drag Jay under.\n\nOr does it? The film isn't over. We see Jay having sex with another of her friends. The ambiguous final shot sees the pair walking hand-in-hand while someone approaches from behind.\n\nTo be fair, this is a well-produced film dripping with atmosphere. The suburban locales evoke a lived-in feel and the Detroit cityscape reeks of urban decay. There's no hyper-kinetic editing or gimmicky found-footage. It's a slow burn. Well, maybe more like a slow singe. Given the script, I'm not sure this film could have been done any better.\n\nBut about that script.\n\nThe opening sequence reveals too much. Consider if we hadn’t seen what happened to the girl waiting by the lake.  Since the creature is only visible to the cursed, the script could have played with the concept of an unreliable narrator. Is the curse real or is Jay having a breakdown? By showing the girl dead in a such a manner, the film loses any ambiguity. The curse is real.\n\nContinuing the too-much-information trend, the film then explains the details of the curse. Worse still, it does it all through dialog.  Rule #1 of good storytelling: Show, don't tell. Rule #1 of good horror: Nothing is scarier than the unknown.\n\nImagine if the film cut from Hugh holding the rag over Jay's mouth to him dumping her on the curb in front of her house. We wouldn't know what had happened to her. When the creature showed up, we'd imagine the worst. By establishing rules and limitations, the filmmakers made the curse less scary. To borrow the film's STD metaphor, it's less like AIDS in the 1980's and more like herpes today.\n\nWhich leads me to the biggest problem of all. Yes this is a horrible curse, but it's manageable. Hell, the film even seems to admit as much. If the thing just walks, then couldn't one just fly to someplace like Australia? Judging by the pool incident, it doesn't like water, which means it probably can't swim, which means you're safe.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject of nit-picks, I'm not sure when this film is set, but how do these kids not have internet access? Wouldn't they search online for information about the curse?\n\nIn the end, _It Follows_ offers little genuine horror, and the manufactured sense of dread wears thin well before the finale. Nor does it offer anything in the way of vicarious thrills. Its attempt to subvert slasher tropes only reinforces their value. Without them, there's nothing to distract us from what’s otherwise a trite premise.\n\n[^1]: In a nice bit of foreshadowing, the movie playing is _Charade (1963)_.\n\n[^2]: It’s a stupid plan. They place various plugged-in electrical items around the pool’s edge. When the thing gets in the water, Jay will somehow get out and they’ll fry it.

I endeavor to describe what a given movie is about, convey a sense of the viewing experience[^1], and give you an idea of how I felt about it.\n\nWith _The Visitor_, I am at a loss.\n\nThe film opens with a blue-eyed Christ-figure telling a story to a group of bald children. The story is about Sateen, an intergalactic criminal who fled to Earth. On Earth, Sateen mutated and developed psychic powers which he used to wreak havoc. Another alien defeated Sateen using an army of birds, but not before Sateen impregnated a slew of Earth women. Those women continued Sateen’s legacy through their children. John Huston then enters the room. He says he’s confirmed Sateen’s latest incarnation is an eight-year-old girl in Atlanta, Georgia. He’ll be leaving at once.\n\nCut to Atlanta, where we meet the aforementioned girl, Katy, her mother Barbara, and her mother’s boyfriend Ray. Lance Henriksen plays Ray, continuing the film’s surprising casting.\n\nKaty is, indeed, pure evil. She’s got a demonic falcon who helps her off a few unfortunate souls who end up on her bad side, including a detective played by Glen Ford.\n\nIn time we learn that Ray is part of a shadowy cabal of Sateen worshippers that want Barbara to bear a son. This son would also possess the powers of Sateen and the cabal could harness them for its own ends. It’s not clear why they can’t use Katy, but this is a minor quibble compared to the rest of the film’s plot holes.\n\nJohn Huston turns out to be the titular Visitor. He’s God, who’s also an alien, and presumably the one who sent the birds to destroy Sateen originally. He’s not there to kill Katy, but to take her back to his world where he’ll teach her not to be evil. Most of the time though, he hangs out on a skyscraper roof with a cadre of bald interpretive dancers. He gives his name as Jerzy Colsowicz and poses as a baby sitter in order to confront Katy. It’s an odd confrontation. The two play Pong on a giant projection screen and dance around the fact that neither of them is human.\n\nShelly Winters plays a nanny hired by Barbara. Her scenes are notable for the instance where she slaps young Katy. According to legend, she really did slap the young girl. Hard. I like to think that it’s true.\n\nCompleting some kind of bizarre casting bingo card, Sam Peckinpah turns up as Barbara’s ex-husband. She visits him for an abortion after the Sateen cabal takes matters into their own hands following Ray’s failure to impregnate Barbara. Unlike John Huston, who appears lucid and sober in his scenes, Peckinpah was allegedly a nightmare to work with and his scenes ended up dubbed.\n\nIf all this seems a little disjointed and bizarre, then I have successfully conveyed a sense of the viewing experience.\n\nThe horror elements are, at times, gruesome. In a scene that would make Lucio Fulci proud, a bird pecks at Glenn Ford’s eyes, forcing him to crash his car. Other times, they’re laughably stilted. Like when Katy makes a basketball explode on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nYet, the film is also, at times, visually striking. An early sequence will get your hopes up. A giant sun fills an orange sky. Two cloaked figures stare each other down across a desert as a sandstorm engulfs them. Scenes like this hint at greatness, but the film can’t string enough of these moments together. It is equal parts fascinating and frustrating.\n\nIf nothing else, _The Visitor_ left me with a strong desire to read a biography of John Huston. If only to understand how the legendary auteur ended up starring in a film so bizarre.\n\n[^1]: As Roger Ebert said, in [Roger’s Little Rule Book](http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/rogers-little-rule-book) “If it is a Pauly Shore comedy, there are people who like them, and they should be able to discover in your review if the new one is down to their usual standard.”","backdrop":null}},{"date":"31 Mar 2015","grade":"C+","slug":"three-on-a-match-1932","sequence":"35","movie":{"title":"Three on a Match","runtimeMinutes":63,"originalTitle":"Three on a Match","year":1932,"directors":[{"fullName":"Mervyn LeRoy"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"Until a 1948 Supreme Court ruling, the five major Hollywood studios controlled the entire movie business, from production to distribution.

The studios contracted performers and paid them a salary. The performers worked five days a week like anyone else. When one film wrapped, they moved to another. Thus, films like _Three on a Match_ came stock-piled with current and future stars.\n\nThe story begins in the fall of 1919. The film sets the time with what's now a common device, a montage of newspaper headlines.  Jack Dempsey wins the world heavyweight title. Prohibition passes. Woman's suffrage passes. Then, a smaller article. The New York City schools are set to reopen after summer vacation.\n\nCut to Public School 64. The camera pans back to reveal a schoolyard teaming with children. Hundreds of them. Were they not twirling about, playing on slides and swings, it would pass for a prison yard. Here, we meet three pre-teen girls.\n\nMary is an exhibitionist. She doesn't mind her bloomers showing while she's playing on the swing or the attention it gets from the boys. Much to the chagrin of class-beauty Vivian. When Mary skips class to smoke cigarettes with some boys, Vivian wants to tell on her. She's dissuaded by studious Ruth.\n\nTime passes with more headlines. The girls are set to graduate. Ruth is valedictorian. Vivian is voted most popular. Mary’s been in so much trouble, she’s almost held back.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Ruth and Vivian talk about their futures. Ruth's family can't afford her going to high school, so she's off to secretarial school so she might get a job. Vivian, however, is off to an exclusive boarding school. They both wonder what will become of Mary.\n\nMore time passes. It's 1925 now. The girls are teenagers. Mary, now played by Joan Blondell, is in reform school. Vivian, now played by Anne Dvorak is reading lewd romance novels to her rapt roommates in Miss Jasons School for Young Ladies. Ruth, now played by Bette Davis, toils away in secretarial school.\n\nNow it’s 1930. Mary sits in a beauty parlor getting her hair done. She’s telling her beautician how she ran into Ruth earlier that day and how she hasn’t seen her since their days at Public School 64. Vivian is at the same beauty parlor and overhears Mary’s mention of Public School 64. Reunited, the three women meet for lunch.\n\nSomething I love about the pictures of this era. Running just over an hour, they had to be efficient. Here, we get ten years of backstory and characterization in under five minutes.\n\nAt lunch, the girls catch up. We learn Mary has turned her life around and is now an actress who’s just gotten her first break. Ruth is working as a secretary. Vivian has married a wealthy lawyer and has a three-year-old son. Mary and Ruth envy Vivian. But Vivian is restless and bored with her life.\n\nSome days later, Vivian talks her husband, Robert, into letting her travel with their son to Europe. Robert agrees, but not without some reluctance. The night they're set to sail, he sees her off. After he leaves, Vivian runs into Mary, who’s now a bona-fide stage star. Mary’s there seeing another friend off. Vivian has the ship's stewardess watch her son and joins Mary's party. She drinks and flirts with a young rake named Michael. Before the ship leaves port, Vivian takes her son and debarks with Michael.\n\nFrom here, Vivian descends into a drug-and-alcohol-fueled nightmare. We see her strung out on the sofa, while her son, dirty and unwashed, begs for some healthy food.\n\nMary, feeling responsible, visits Robert and tells him where to find Vivian. Robert reclaims his son and divorces Vivian.  Mary and Robert grow closer. On the day his divorce is final, he asks Mary to become his wife. Mary agrees. Ruth joins the family as a nanny.\n\nIn between, we have the obligatory pre-code shot of a woman putting on her stockings. Here, it’s Bette Davis.\n\nMeanwhile, Vivian has continued her fall from grace. Michael turns out to be a gambler and the two are now desperate for money to feed their habits. Vivian, waiting outside the same uptown apartment building she used to call home, begs Mary for money. After they burn through that, Michael tries extorting Robert. When that doesn’t work, Michael kidnap’s Robert’s son.\n\nUnfortunately for all involved, Michael owes money to a mobster named Ace, played by Edward Arnold. Ace gets wind of the plot and muscles his way in via his henchman Harve, played by Humphrey Bogart. When the heat closes in, Harve leans on Michael to off the kid. Vivian, in a moment of lucidity during her withdrawal haze, saves her son in a startling (and over the top) fashion.\n\nIt’s a lot of plot for 63 minutes. This is a good thing. Things move so fast we’re not given much time to consider the insanity. And make no mistake, this movie is nuts. Vivian’s fall from society lady to street-corner junkie plays like a caricature. Mary wastes her school years getting into trouble and ends up a society darling. Vivian spends her life doing what’s expected of her and sees her world collapse the first time she steps out of line. And Ruth, poor Ruth. She works, head down, as hard as she can, only to end up working for Mary. How’s that for a mixed message?\n\nBut _Three on a Match_ works despite all the crazy. Or is it because of it? I’m not sure. With a cast this good, one is hard-pressed to care.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"28 Mar 2015","grade":"D+","slug":"dangerous-mission-1954","sequence":"34","movie":{"title":"Dangerous Mission","runtimeMinutes":75,"originalTitle":"Dangerous Mission","year":1954,"directors":[{"fullName":"Louis King"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Dangerous Mission_ isn’t a very good movie.

But for some folks it may be worth a look. To explain why, I must venture into spoiler territory.\n\nConsider this fair warning.\n\nThe film opens with a murder. We’re looking down a set of stairs into a darkened, deserted nightclub. A man sits playing a piano with his back to us. Another man appears atop the stairs. He has a gun. He sneaks down and creeps across the nightclub floor. There’s a flash of lightning and a crack of thunder from the storm outside. The piano player turns, and the gunman shoots twice. The piano player drops dead. Then we hear footsteps and a woman scream. The gunman whirls towards us and fires. We hear the sound of running and a door closing. The gunman hurries after the mystery woman.\n\nNext we're in a posh high-rise office. Two weeks have passed. The rain hasn’t stopped. The gunman, Johnny, sits on a couch. He pokes at a toy piano, playing the same melody the piano player played before he died.\n\nWe learn that Johnny is out on bail. He’s planning to claim self-defense at the trial, but the District Attorney has a witness that could put Johnny away for a long time. Johnny thinks he knows where the witness is hiding and wants her out of the picture.\n\n“That’s your job,” Johnny says to a man sitting in a chair with his back to us. Now, here’s where things get confusing. They know where the witness is hiding, but they don’t know her identity. They have a guess, but they’re not sure. So the mystery hitman’s job is to fly out, rent a car, then go undercover. Mingle with the people and suss out the witness’s identity. Then kill her, but make it look like an accident.\n\n“What a hideout,” Johnny says. “No wonder we couldn’t find it until yesterday. It’s the last place in the world you’d expect anyone to hide.”\n\nCut to Glacier National Park in Montana. We see Matt Hallett, played by Victor Mature, entering the park in a rented car. The guard at the gate spies a gun in Matt’s glove compartment and phones it in to Chief Ranger Joe, played by William Bendix.\n\nFor the next half-hour or so, the film plays like a would-be suspenseful mystery. The script tries in vain to make us suspect  Matt as the hired killer. It helps that Mature has a way of talking where his entire body remains motionless except his jaw. It kept reminding me of a ventriloquist’s dummy. Certainly creepy enough to be a believable sociopath.\n\nBut, of course, we know better. This would-be misdirection gives Vincent Price a chance to do what he does best, play a character playing someone else. Here, he plays Paul Adams, a mob hitman playing a nature photographer. Early on, he’s all folksy smiles and good humor, but still comes off as something of a dilettante with a hint of menace.\n\nMatt and Paul both vie for the attention of the witness, Louise, played by Piper Laurie. Given that Louise is the only woman that comes close to fitting the witness’s description in the entire park, I’m not so sure it was such a good place to hide.\n\nLouise is cordial to Paul, but finds herself drawn to Matt. In between, there’s a sub-plot involving a fugitive Indian and his daughter, an avalanche, and a forest fire.  Most of these diversions exist to exploit the film’s 3D presentation. I suppose they do a decent enough job, but they also give us the impression that Glacier Park is something of a death trap.\n\nAnyway, a little before the halfway point, Paul’s true identity is revealed. Though we see it coming, the scene isn’t without a surprise. From here, the film shifts into adventure, as Paul has to kill Louise and flee the park. But despite being a professional killer, he fails to off Louise, and she alerts the park authorities. With all the roads closed, Paul has to flee overground.\n\nMatt, now revealed as a cop working for the New York District Attorney’s office, sets out after Paul. Of course, Louise somehow ends up going with him. There’s some great location photography, and everything culminates in a showdown inside an ice fissure. It’s a scene that would have looked great shot in a real ice cave. Instead, the soundstage artifice is all the more glaring. You’ll be hard-pressed not to laugh.\n\nAs I said, _Dangerous Mission_ is not a good movie. The convoluted script and uneven production values see to that. But fans of Vincent Price should enjoy him here, if only for the outfit he wears for the square-dance scene.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"06 Mar 2015","grade":"A-","slug":"a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night-2014","sequence":"33","movie":{"title":"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night","runtimeMinutes":101,"originalTitle":"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night","year":2014,"directors":[{"fullName":"Ana Lily Amirpour"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night_ bills itself as the first Iranian Vampire Western.

This is misleading. Like all good movies, it transcends borders. A more accurate tagline might be “The first Persian language Vampire Western.”\n\nThe film takes place in Bad City, a nightmarish amalgam of urban decay and frontier isolation. It’s a place where the dead lay dumped in dried river beds like so much garbage. Its streets alternate between rows of cookie-cutter homes and desolate alleyways. In the distance, oil rigs pump up and down like crows picking at the dead earth’s skin.\n\nWe follow a group of colorful characters with intersecting stories. There’s Arash, a young man who dresses in white t-shirts and pegged jeans. His prized possession is a 1957 Ford Thunderbird convertible he worked 2,191 days to afford. Arash’s father, Hossein, is a widower and heroin addict. Hossein’s dealer, Saeed has the word “SEX” tattooed across the front of his throat. Saeed is also a pimp for Atti, who’s just turned thirty and dreams of escaping the life of a street walker.\n\nWeaving through these narratives is the girl. She’s a vampire. She lives in a small, one-room apartment. New-wave posters plaster the walls. At night she emerges in a pitch-black chador to prey on the city’s destitute and depraved. There is a loneliness in her that actress Sheila Vand conveys despite having little dialog.\n\nArash and the girl’s paths cross, first in passing then again in one of the film’s cleverest scenes. Arash has been to a costume party and gotten lost walking home. He’s high on Ecstasy, staring open mouthed at a streetlight when the girl spots him. He’s wearing a Dracula costume that prompts something of a double-take by her. Their eyes meet. There is a connection. They sense the loneliness in one-another. In a near wordless scene, she takes him back to her small apartment. She puts on a record and he holds her close, wanting nothing more than the company. It is something out of a teenage fantasy, yet the scene works because the film doesn’t try to sell it. There are no speeches or orchestral swells, just the two performers and the song _Death_ from White Lies.\n\nI’m going to talk about the ending now. If what I’ve written so far has piqued your curiosity, I encourage you to give the film a look. I’d rather not spoil the ending, but if you’re still on the fence, read on and perhaps I can persuade you.\n\nStill, here? Okay, here we go.\n\nTo appreciate why _A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night_ is a great film, we must discuss the final scene.\n\nArash and the girl are driving out of town. Arash doesn't know that she's a vampire, but he knows that she killed his father. The girl doesn’t know that the man she killed was Arash’s father, but she knows he’s having second thoughts. They drive in silence. After a bit, Arash pulls the car over. He gets out and paces in the headlights. His fists clench and unclench. He runs his hands through his hair. The emotions wash over him. The girl watches in silence. We don’t fear for him, we fear for her feelings. In a Hollywood production this scene would include a monologue followed by an emotional exchange. Writer-director Ana Lily Amirpour gives us something far more powerful in the silence.\n\nIn time Arash straightens, gets back in the car and pulls onto the road. They leave Bad City.\n\nIt’s a perfect ending, and one that stuck with me long after I’d walked out of the theater. Howard Hawks said that a great movie consisted of “Three good scenes and no bad ones.” _A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night_ has this and more.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"02 Mar 2015","grade":"D+","slug":"to-the-devil-a-daughter-1976","sequence":"32","movie":{"title":"To the Devil a Daughter","runtimeMinutes":95,"originalTitle":"To the Devil a Daughter","year":1976,"directors":[{"fullName":"Peter Sykes"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_To the Devil a Daughter_ was the final film of Hammer Film Productions[^1].

The studio rose to prominence with films such as _Curse of Frankenstein (1957)_ and _Horror of Dracula (1958)_. Unlike those staged, period pieces, this film is set in contemporary times and shot on location. It represented a big departure for Hammer, but it was too little too late.\n\nThe story—ah, well, you’ll have to bear with me here. I’ve seen the movie twice and I’m still not sure about some of the details. According the featurette on Anchor Bay’s DVD, the filmmaker’s were writing the script as they went along. It shows in the final product.\n\nAs near as I can tell, Father Michael, played by Christopher Lee, is a priest who commits the heresy of putting his faith in man over God. To that end—and here’s where things get fuzzy—he retreats to a compound in Bavaria where he forms his own Satanic religion which masquerades as Catholicism. One of his acolytes dies during childbirth and Father Michael baptizes the baby, a girl, in her dead mother’s blood. The girl, Catherine, grows up as a nun in Father Michael’s compound. On her eighteenth birthday she travels to London. There, Father Michael will baptize her in the blood of a demon creature birthed by another of Father Michael’s acolytes[^2].\n\nBut, fortunately for humanity, Catherine’s father, Henry, has a change of heart. Henry appeals to occult novelist John Verney, played by Richard Widmark. Verney intercepts Catherine at Heathrow airport. Verney had hoped to get a book out of Henry’s story, but soon realizes the stakes are much higher.\n\nFather Michael attempts to reclaim Catherine by possessing her. Verney tries to keep her safe. During the tug-of-war we’re presented with a couple of disturbing scenes.\n\nThe first concerns the birth of the demon creature. Picture a staged, antiseptic facsimile of a young girl's bedroom. On the bed, a woman prepares to give birth. Strips of white cloth bind her wrists to the headboard and clamp her knees and ankles shut, giving the baby no escape. Arms spread, knees clenched, she lays crucified. Her face glistens with sweat as her back arches and her body spasms from another contraction. Her belly swells. Beside her, Father Michael stands waiting, smiling with eager eyes.\n\nAnd later, we see one of Catherine’s visions/dreams. We’re looking through her eyes. She’s pregnant and laying on her back. We see her bulging womb. Her legs are open, knees up, in the traditional birthing position. Still through her eyes, we see something crawling up from between her legs. At first glimpse it seems to be a baby, but no, it's a horrid combination of baby and beast with a monstrous jaw and reptilian eyes. Covered in blood, it writhes between her legs, smearing her thighs and stomach with gore. She reaches down and strokes the creature's grotesque head. Now her midsection is awash in thick, almost syrupy, blood as she gently pushes the thing back down, between her legs. Still through her eyes, we hear her moan in a mixture of agony and ecstasy as she forces the monstrosity _back up into her womb_.\n\nThe quality of the creature effects in this scene is laughable. And what’s worse the scene has little to do with the story. Instead, it feels like something tacked on as a reaction to _Rosemary’s Baby (1968)_ and _The Exorcist (1973)_.\n\nAnd it’s when you compare this film to those, that one realizes how far Hammer had fallen.\n\nThis was a studio that, nineteen years prior, had revived the horror genre by injecting a liberal dose of gore and sex into the monster movie. The resulting films were edgy and fresh.\n\nBut time passed. Those kids who flocked theaters for Hammer’s earlier films now had kids of their own. To this new generation, Hammer’s period monster movies were passé. They were your _parent’s_ horror movies. Even this wave of satanic themed films was on it’s nadir. Two years later _Halloween (1978)_ would usher in the slasher genre that would dominate horror for the next decade.\n\nBy the time Hammer woke up and tried to tap into the mainstream horror pulse, it lacked the resources to pull off a competent film. Christopher Lee does his best, but Richard Widmark looks tired and annoyed. He’s just cashing a paycheck.\n\nThe worst part is the ending. Remember how I said they were writing the script as they went along? As it turns out, they ran out of money by the time they got to the end. After an hour and a half of buildup, Verney and Father Michael square off in a mausoleum. Father Michael stands in a large circle made of blood.\n\nSays Verney, “You really think this circle will protect you, don’t you? It won’t.”\n\n“But it will,” says Father Michael. “Because this circle stands upon a hill of flint, and flint is the sacred stone of Astaroth.”\n\nVerney holds up a rock he literally just picked up five minutes earlier and used to club one of Father Michael’s henchman. “But this sacred stone of Astaroth has the blood of your disciple on it. Now, the demons will protect me.”\n\nVerney steps into the circle and throws the rock at Father Michael, hitting him on the head. Father Michael falls to the ground and disappears. Movie over. That’s the ending. A mumbo-jumbo bit of rock-paper-scissors involving flint and the blood of a disciple. Two bits of information _never mentioned in the film before_.\n\nIf this was the best Hammer could do, then the studio’s death was a mercy killing[^3].\n\n[^1]: Until the studio was resurrected in 2008.\n[^2]: I’m willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume Father Michael wasn’t doing this for Satan, but for his own gain. That he’s somehow brought about the birth of a demon and by baptizing Catherine in its blood, he could control its power. I know that’s reaching, but I’ve got a soft spot for Hammer.\n[^3]: Okay, so the studio didn’t _die_, it just produced television instead of movies.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"26 Feb 2015","grade":"D+","slug":"the-long-night-1947","sequence":"31","movie":{"title":"The Long Night","runtimeMinutes":101,"originalTitle":"The Long Night","year":1947,"directors":[{"fullName":"Anatole Litvak"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_The Long Night_ starts well, only to lose its way in the third act.","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_The Long Night_ starts well, only to lose its way in the third act.\n\nThe story opens with a murder. We’re inside an apartment building on the working-class side of the tracks. We hear gunshots. A man staggers out of a unit holding his gut and tumbles down the stairs. The police arrive. They attempt to extract the shooter. Through a door, the shooter says he wants to be left alone. We recognize the voice as Henry Fonda’s.\n\nThrough flashbacks, we learn that Henry Fonda plays Joe, a veteran recently returned from World War II. He’s a wholesome guy. He drinks milk and uses exclamations like, “No kidding!”\n\nOne day, while working as a sandblaster at the local plant, Joe meets a young girl named Jo Anne, played by Barbara Bel Geddes. Joe and Jo Anne hit it off. The film would have us believe this is natural since they’re both orphans and they’re both named Joe. They begin dating. Joe falls hard.\n\nOne night, Jo Anne cancels a date with Joe. She has something to do. Joe says that’s fine, but takes Jo Anne’s favorite stuffed animal hostage as a bit of insurance that she’ll see him again. It’s a nice touch that gives Joe some edge and helps make the film’s later events more plausible.\n\nJoe ends up tailing Jo Anne to a dingy club where a magician is performing. Vincent Price plays the magician. We recognize him as the man who was shot during the film’s opening.\n\nAt the bar, Joe meets Charlene, played by Ann Dvorak. Through Charlene, we learn the magician’s name is Maximilian. Charlene was one of his assistants. She’s just now decided to leave him, having grown tired of his manipulative ways.\n\nJoe watches Jo Anne. She seems enraptured by Maximilian’s performance and approaches him after the show. Maximilian’s tells her to meet him at his table. Joe’s seen enough.\n\nBefore joining Jo Anne, however, Maximilian approaches Joe and Charlene at the bar. It’s here we get our first taste of Maximilian’s condescending wit. He tries to cajole Charlene into changing her mind. Joe tells Maximilian to scram. Maximilian replies with a sarcastic grin, “My friend, there is no one I would like disagreeing with more than you. However, under the circumstances, there’s hardly any point in continuing our conversation.” Then, to Charlene, “Till tomorrow, my dear.”\n\nCharlene develops a torch for Joe. Joe, feeling hurt by Jo Anne, uses Charlene for companionship. She’s more or less emotional collateral damage by the film’s end. Dvorak makes the most of a part that exists only to show Joe turning to the dark side when he thinks he’s lost Jo Anne.\n\nAs the story goes on, we learn the depths of Maximilian’s debauchery. How he’s seduced and manipulated countless naive young girls like Jo Anne. Each new bit of knowledge cuts at Joe.\n\nIt all builds to a showdown between Joe and Maximilian. The confrontation doesn’t disappoint. Price is great in the part despite being a decade too young. Like all of Price’s best roles, he plays a showman, one capable of immense charm on stage, and immense debauchery off stage. He talks circles around Fonda, each word dripping with condescension. Fonda plays on this, his frustration building and building until it boils over.\n\nWhich brings us to where we came in. And here’s where movie goes wrong. The tone shifts from noir to populist drama. The town rallies around Joe in his standoff with the police. Jo Anne fights through a never-ending mob in an effort to reach Joe. She’s knocked down by someone carrying a bicycle. Won’t the police please just let her talk to Joe, she pleads. But they won’t. Which leads to more shots of Jo Anne fighting her way through the crowd. As if this all weren’t bad enough, the film closes on a cornball line. As he’s escorted out by the police, Joe asks one of the crowd for a light. The man lights Joe’s cigarette and asks, “How you doing, Joe?” Joe replies, “I think we’ll make it, Freddy. Just about make it.”\n\nNo Joe, not with a disingenuous ending like that, you won’t.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"23 Feb 2015","grade":"C+","slug":"kingsman-the-secret-service-2014","sequence":"30","movie":{"title":"Kingsman: The Secret Service","runtimeMinutes":129,"originalTitle":"Kingsman: The Secret Service","year":2014,"directors":[{"fullName":"Matthew Vaughn"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Kingsman: The Secret Service_ tells the story of a young man named Gary who goes by Eggsy.

Before he leaves, Harry offers Eggsy a chance to try out for the Kingsmen.\n\nAnd so Eggsy goes to spy-school. In keeping with the dapper gentleman theme, spy-school is more like boarding school than boot camp. When they're not practicing with sniper rifles or parachuting out of planes, the fresh-faced recruits wear uniforms resembling flannel suit pajamas.\n\nOf course, every spy story needs a super villain. Here we’re given Richmond Valentine, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Valentine is an internet billionaire who speaks with a lisp, hates the sight of blood, and dresses like a teenager. Convinced mankind is a virus doomed to destroy the planet, Valentine plans to wipe out eighty-five percent of the human race. Naturally, he’ll pick the fifteen percent that will survive.\n\nAnd every super villain needs a colorful henchman. Valentine has Gazelle, a double leg amputee whose prosthetics also act as swords capable of slicing a man in half. Spoiler alert: she slices someone in half.\n\nAs the film builds to the inevitable confrontation between Eggsy and Valentine, it becomes increasingly ludicrous. Gazelle dismembers an armed cadre of elite security officers. Harry single-handedly kills a church full of people. Eggsy picks off Valentine’s henchman while somersaulting through the air in slow motion. Heads explode in a rainbow spray of gore.\n\nSure, it's silly, but the juxtaposition of the mild mannered Firth and the comical violence leaves the film with nowhere to go but over-the-top. There's even a scene between Firth and Samuel L. Jackson where they have a black-tie dinner consisting of Big Macs. I can't imagine anyone but Firth pulling that off.\n\nBut casting Firth is not without its downsides. With someone like Clive Owen, the film could have gone with a more serious and cynical tone. The script flirts with having something to say about elitism and class hierarchy, but it’s lost amid the silliness.\n\nAs I said earlier, the film is full of superfluous bits. There are characters with no payoff. Roxy, another Kingsmen recruit seems to exist only to make Eggsy seem nicer than the other male recruits. She's an afterthought by the time we reach the finale. And then there are the plot holes. Like how an ultra secret organization allows most of its recruiting class to walk away after failing to make the cut. Or how an intelligence organization like the Kingsmen doesn’t have its own satellites. This is sloppy storytelling, but one is hard-pressed to care given the film’s relentless spectacle.\n\nIn the end, _Kingsman: The Secret Service_ is little more than an adolescent male super-spy fantasy. That said, it’s not bad. It's a throwback to the days when James Bond seemed to relish his job and the films favored adventure over angst. It may not be a great film, but it sure is entertaining.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"14 Feb 2015","grade":"F","slug":"where-danger-lives-1950","sequence":"29","movie":{"title":"Where Danger Lives","runtimeMinutes":82,"originalTitle":"Where Danger Lives","year":1950,"directors":[{"fullName":"John Farrow"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"I usually warn folks when I’m going to spoil plot points, but in the case of _Where Danger Lives_, I don't think it matters.

This is one of those films where the hero takes the entire movie to deduce what the audience figures out in the first ten minutes.\n\nThe film opens with doctor Jeff Cameron treating a little girl. Jeff is telling her a story about elephants. Robert Mitchum plays Jeff. He’s miscast in a part that would better suit Henry Fonda, but that’s the least of the film’s problems.\n\nAfter finishing with the little girl, Jeff clocks out, eager for  his date with Julie, a nice nurse who works at the hospital. But Jeff has to cancel after he's called to assist with a new patient.\n\nThe patient is Margo, a not-so-wholesome girl who’d just attempted suicide. Jeff treats Margo, then the two start dating. He falls hard. Faith Domergue plays Margo. Like Mitchum, she’s miscast. But unlike Mitchum, it’s hard to overlook just how wrong she is for the role. To be fair, it’s a hard part to play.\nMargo has to do more than seduce Jeff, she has to seduce the entire audience. We have to buy Jeff overlooking a myriad of red flags and throwing his life away for a woman he just met.\n\nBut we don’t buy it. The entire romance is unconvincing.\n\nSoon Margo breaks it to Jeff that she has to leave for Nassau. It seems her father has come home, and upon finding out about Jeff, decided it best that Margo take a trip.\n\nJeff doesn’t take it well. He has a few too many and goes to Margo’s house. He confronts her father, Mr. Lannington, played by third-billed Claude Rains in his only scene. Here, Jeff discovers the first of many things we already suspected. Lannington isn't her father at all, but her husband![^1]\n\nJeff and Lannington get into a scuffle. Jeff knocks down Lannington who gets back up and pummels Jeff with a fireplace poker. Jeff clocks Lannington, knocking him out cold. Jeff, still reeling, stumbles to the bathroom for some water. When he returns, Margo tells Jeff that Lannington is dead.[^1]\n\nNow, at this point it's obvious to us that Margo killed her husband while Jeff was out of the room. But, since the rest of the film hinges on Jeff believing he did it, a series of contrived plot machinations are necessary. As the film rolls on the pair will ”just miss\" the news. The car radio won’t work. Someone will draw a beard on Margo’s police picture, preventing her from being recognized.\n\nAnyway, Margo convinces Jeff to make a run for the Mexico border. Jeff agrees. The film explains this by having Jeff tell us he has a concussion. This is the worst concussion you've ever seen. Jeff blacks out, loses the ability to think straight, and by the time the film's predictable conclusion rolls around, finds the left side of his body paralyzed.\n\nFrom here the film shifts to a road movie. Margo and Jeff prowl through the small, out-of-the-way towns of the southwest and descend into a kind of backwoods hell. In one town they’re nearly thrown in jail after a fender-bender with a drunken immigrant. In another they’re brought before the town sheriff for being clean shaven during “Whiskers Week.”\n\nEventually, the film tells us that Margo is crazy. It’s played as a big reveal, but we’ve known it all along. After all, didn’t Jeff meet her because she’d tried to commit suicide?\n\nEverything wraps up near the Mexico border. Jeff and Margo are holed up in a dingy hotel room. Margo reveals she’d been stashing Lannington’s money in a Mexican bank. Jeff finally realizes that Margo killed Lannington. Margo smothers Jeff with a pillow and heads for the border. She’s almost across when she sees Jeff shambling down the street toward her. She begs him to stop, to not come any further.\n\nDomergue doesn’t look like a desperate woman, she looks like an actress unsure of what to do. “Don’t make me shoot,” she says to no one as she pulls a small revolver from her purse.\n\nJeff keeps coming. Margo shoots and misses. The border guards shoot Margo, who dies, but not before confessing to the authorities that she killed Lannington alone. Jeff wakes up in a hospital. He’s going to be okay. Julie is there waiting.\n\n_Where Danger Lives_ isn’t as awful as it is frustrating. The film treats us like simpletons, expecting us to swallow one trite plot twist after another while ignoring Domergue’s stilted performance. I tried, but I just couldn’t do it. Maybe a concussion would have helped.\n\n[^1]: Cue ominous music: _Duh-duh-dum!_","backdrop":null}},{"date":"09 Feb 2015","grade":"D+","slug":"the-crimson-cult-1968","sequence":"28","movie":{"title":"The Crimson Cult","runtimeMinutes":89,"originalTitle":"Curse of the Crimson Altar","year":1968,"directors":[{"fullName":"Vernon Sewell"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Curse of the Crimson Altar_ (_The Crimson Cult_ here in the USA) has a good cast, but it is not a good film.

This is evident from the opening scene.\n\nA droning hum whines in and out as a young man named Peter Manning stands wearing a suit. He looks dazed. In front of him, a nude woman suffers a whip while lying strapped to a table. Men in black robes look on. One has a goat. Wearing a large headdress complete with ram horns, a green-skinned Barbra Steel introduces herself as Lavinia, the \"Keeper of the Black Secret”[^1]. She asks if Peter knows why he's there. He does. She asks if he's ready to sign. He is. A man brings over a large book and Peter signs his name. Then Lavinia hands Peter a dagger. Peter stabs the girl on the table. There's a quick-cut to the goat, which seems distressed. Lavinia snaps her fingers. There's a crack of thunder. A muscular man dressed in a leather bikini bottom, leather arm-bands, and a studded leather cap sprouting deer antlers brings over a branding iron which he presses into Peter's chest.\n\nYes, that happens. The film packs a few more of these trippy, S&M-tinged sequences, but they exist more-or-less outside the main narrative.\n\nThe story concerns Peter's brother, Robert, played by Mark Eden. When Peter doesn't return home, Robert goes looking for him at his last known location, a remote country estate called Craxton Lodge. Robert's arrival coincides with a local festival celebrating the burning of the witch Lavinia some three hundred years earlier. The estate’s owner, J.D. Morely, played by Christopher Lee, claims to have never heard of Peter, but invites Robert to stay on to continue his search. Robert agrees. Robert also meets another of the locals, Professor Marsh, played by Boris Karloff. Marsh, conveniently, is an expert on witchcraft.\n\nAs the film unwinds, the tone veers between cult conspiracy and Scooby-Doo mystery. Robert discovers secret doors and a fake spiderweb machine en-route to learning the truth behind his brother’s disappearance. But by the time the credits roll we're left wondering if the scenes with Lavinia were meant to be real or imagined.\n\nSometimes ambiguity helps a film resonate. But in this case, it only serves to underscore the film's patronizing approach to its horror elements. Consider the poor attempt at meta-humor. When one of the characters compares Craxton Lodge to “one of those old houses in horror films,” Robert replies, “It’s like Boris Karloff’s going to pop up at any moment.”\n\nAfter my first viewing of _The Curse of the Crimson Altar_ , I considered it something of a guilty pleasure. The over-the-top dream sequences and gratuitous nudity were good for a chuckle.\n\nBut watching it a second time, I found the film far less entertaining. Sure, Karloff is great. Even wheelchair-bound at eighty-years-old, he could still command a scene. But that’s about all this movie has going for it. Lee’s role gives him little to do, and Barbara Steele is wasted. The story’s mystery elements, already weak on the first viewing, border on tedious the second time around.\n\nGiven that this was one of Karloff’s final films, it’s probably required viewing for any serious fan of classic horror. Just don't watch it a second time.\n\n[^1]: For the record, there is no _Crimson_ Altar or _Crimson_ Cult.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"06 Feb 2015","grade":"C+","slug":"the-town-that-dreaded-sundown-2014","sequence":"27","movie":{"title":"The Town That Dreaded Sundown","runtimeMinutes":86,"originalTitle":"The Town That Dreaded Sundown","year":2014,"directors":[{"fullName":"Alfonso Gomez-Rejon"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ starts with a prologue recounting a series of unsolved murders that occurred in Texarkana in 1946.

It talks about how those killings formed the basis for the original film, _The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976)_, which screens every Halloween somewhere in Texarkana.\n\nThe film opens on one of those screenings. It's a drive-in. The camera pans down to a teen couple sitting on the hood of a car. He seems into the film, but she looks uneasy. She says it’s not her kind of movie. He asks her if she wants to go. She does, and they head out. As they leave, the camera picks up a preacher imploring the patrons to remember that people really died back in 1946.\n\nThe couple head out for a quiet, deserted area where they can be alone. He makes small talk as they drive. The camera shows them at a tilted angle. It's an on-the-nose gimmick that foreshadows one of the film's biggest weaknesses.\n\nSoon they're parked. They start kissing, but the girl spots a man in the nearby woods. He's dressed just like the killer from the movie. But this is no prank. The man breaks the car's window with the butt of a revolver. He orders them out of the car at gunpoint, then forces the girl to turn around while he stabs the boy to death.\n\nAnd we're off and running. By genre definitions, the film is a slasher, but I'm always hesitant to use that term. For many people, that equates to the _Friday the 13th_ and _Halloween_ series of films, which were, for the most part, more monster and survival-horror films than slasher. _The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ is more of a violent mystery. Victims are stalked and murdered in a brutal but stylish manner and we work along with the protagonist to deduce the killer's identity from a number of suspects. To that end, _The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ may be the first rural giallo.\n\nThere's a lot to like. The supporting cast includes Edward Herrmann as the aforementioned preacher, and Gary Cole as a sheriff’s deputy.\n\nThe script’s meta-sequel approach works well. It avoids the trap of aggrandizing the original film by regulating it to well-researched pulp entertainment. Granted, this film does play as something of a remake, but by excising the original’s head-scratching bits of comic relief, this entry crafts a much taunter narrative.\n\nBut the film is far from perfect. Remember the gimmick shot I mentioned earlier? The movie is full of them. Some of them work, but their impact is lost in the shuffle.\n\nConsider the scene, set at night, where a woman flees the killer into a huge wheat field. The killer has a gun. He fires and she drops to the ground amid the wheat. He approaches, but can’t find the body. Cut to a bird’s eye shot of the field and we see the woman crawling away from the killer as he stalks forward. They’re not more than six feet apart, but they can’t see each other. The shot’s only held for a few moments before we cut back to a tight shot of the killer.\n\nWhy? That was a great shot. Keep it. Cut the music. Just give us the sound of the wind and let us watch from above as she crawls, hoping against hope that he doesn’t see her. Their meeting is inevitable, but the tension would have been palpable watching the two skew towards one another.\n\nAnd then there’s the ending.\n\nBut before we get to that, let me say that I liked the movie. The location photography, colorful supporting cast, and competent script make for a solid little slasher. So, having said that, and having given you a sense of what the film is about and what it’s like, I feel my job as reviewer is done. If you want to stop reading here, I’ll understand.\n\nStill with me? Okay. I didn’t love the ending. I didn’t hate it either. It felt like a missed opportunity.\n\nHere’s why. The script touches on the notion of violence inspired by the media several times, but only in passing. I felt the film was building to something however, and when the heroine makes to leave town with her grandmother, it struck me. What if this is the end of the movie? She leaves and the killer is never caught. The end. All the bits about inspired violence coalesce into a biting commentary. The killer will be there as long as he has an audience. It would even dovetail nicely with the original's ambiguous ending.\n\nSure, some folks would hate it, but I bet a lot of theater-goers hated the original’s ending too. And yet, that ending helped the original resonate enough to inspire a remake almost forty years later.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"04 Feb 2015","grade":"B-","slug":"the-big-steal-1949","sequence":"26","movie":{"title":"The Big Steal","runtimeMinutes":71,"originalTitle":"The Big Steal","year":1949,"directors":[{"fullName":"Don Siegel"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"Like any good script, _The Big Steal_ starts as late into the story as possible.

Mitchum takes Bendix's gun and identification. The identification reads: Captain Vincent Blake of the US Army.\n\nAfter debarking, Mitchum crosses paths with Jane Greer. It's a short meeting, as Mitchum has to duck out of sight as Bendix emerges from the ship. Once the coast is clear, Mitchum tries to catch a cab, only to find Greer has gotten the last one.\n\nCut to a room inside the Hotel Mexico. We see Patric Knowles packing. He’s in a rush. His eyes are darting around. There's a knock at the door. Knowles pulls a gun and moves to the side of the door, ready to plug whoever comes in. Then we hear Greer's voice, telling him to open up. We learn that Knowles is Greer's fiancee. But she's not there to marry him, she's there because he ran off with her savings, about two thousand dollars. She wants it back.\n\nKnowles tries to sweet talk her, but Greer cuts him off saying, \"The last time you did that it cost me my bank account.\" Knowles tries to make her feel bad for harping on him about the money saying, \"There's that dollar sign again.\" But Greer snaps back, \"Where? I don't see it. Come on, hand it over.\" Then, dripping with sarcasm, \"I was saving that money for my trousseau.”\n\nKnowles gives Greer the slip, and a few beats later we learn that Mitchum is after Knowles too.\n\nThus, the film is set. It’s one big chase. Bendix chases Mitchum who, along with Greer, chases Knowles. Mitchum and Greer form an uneasy partnership as they travel across the Mexican countryside from Veracruz to Tehuacán[^1].  As the story unfolds we learn what was stolen, and who did the stealing. Mitchum and Greer warm to each other. Everything culminates in a surprising, but satisfying finale.\n\nOn paper, it's another forgettable lower-budget entry from RKO, the once premier studio that had fallen to disarray under Howard Hughes. But thanks to a crackerjack script, _The Big Steal_ is better than it probably had any right to be.\n\nConsider how little information we're given as the movie begins. Rather than open with a flashback or exposition, we’re thrown right into one unnamed man confronting another over an event we know nothing about. That’s great storytelling. But it’s when Greer confronts Knowles that the script really sparkles.\n\nIt's refreshing to see such an independent female character. She's self assured without being arrogant. Insistent without being whiny. The script may leave the fisticuffs to the men, but Greer's character holds her own in the numerous bouts of verbal sparring.\n\nThe script also does a great job of subverting our expectations. From the anything-but-inept Mexican police inspector, to Greer—not Mitchum—being the one to get them out of various jams, the script defies the genre’s conventions.\n\nAnd topping it all off, there's a nice touch where Mitchum actually wears some of the results of his tussles. From a bloody nose to a beaten face, the film’s fights have visible consequences. Something all too rare in Hollywood.\n\nGranted, it's not a perfect film. The extended car chase feels tacked on and forced. And Knowles and Bendix don't quite hold their own against Mitchum and Greer in terms of star wattage. But really, these are weaknesses instead of faults. _The Big Steal_ takes a B-movie plot and elevates it to near greatness thanks to a well-crafted script peppered with crackling dialog.\n\n[^1]: They actually shot in Mexico, which helps to belie the film’s modest budget.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"30 Jan 2015","grade":"D+","slug":"rasputin-the-mad-monk-1966","sequence":"25","movie":{"title":"Rasputin: The Mad Monk","runtimeMinutes":91,"originalTitle":"Rasputin: The Mad Monk","year":1966,"directors":[{"fullName":"Don Sharp"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Rasputin: The Mad Monk_ opens with Rasputin, played by Christopher Lee, arriving at an inn and demanding wine.

Rasputin gets good and drunk and takes the innkeeper's daughter out to the barn. This doesn't sit well with her young suitor who brawls with Rasputin. Rasputin chops the young lad's hand off saying, \"He won't trouble us anymore,\" then makes to get back with the daughter.

It treats the character of Rasputin as a one-dimensional monster. This wouldn’t be so bad, but the talky script vacillates between biographical drama and horror without committing to either.

After landing, he and the Duke set out to call on their young friend, Simon. What they find upon arriving at Simon's palatial house alarms the Duke. It seems Simon has fallen in with a group of Satanists led by the sinister Mocata, played by Charles Gray. As the Duke says, “Simon is playing the most dangerous game known to mankind.”\n\nLee’s dialog is full of lines like that. They should induce groans, but Lee pulls them off with flair. He opens the commentary track on the DVD saying that he’s largely responsible for the film being made. He was a big fan of the novel by Dennis Wheatley and brought the book to the attention of studio executives. His performance is reminiscent of Peter Cushing’s turn as Van Helsing in _Horror of Dracula (1958)_, and his admiration of the source material shines through.\n\nOpposite Lee, Gray delivers a smooth, understated performance that’s almost as magnetic as Lee's[^1]. Consider the scene where he calls on the Duke's niece in an attempt to extract Simon. She makes to throw him out, but he leaves of his own accord saying, “I'm leaving. I shall not be back. But something will.” He pauses for a moment then adds, “Tonight. Something will come for Simon and the girl.” His tone is casual, not threatening, and all the more menacing for it.\n\nDespite the supernatural elements, _The Devil Rides Out_  isn’t really a horror movie at all[^2].
