Cut to a man aboard a boat approaching the Tower Bridge. He raises his arm to check the time. Zoom in on his wristwatch. It’s just after dawn.\n\nCut to another wristwatch. Pull back to reveal a man smoking a cigarette in a car. He glances at the rear-view mirror and gives a slight nod. Two linebacker-sized men get out and unload a swath of equipment, including a large coil of thick rope. The car pulls away and speeds across Tower Bridge, stopping on the opposite side. The driver and passenger exit the car, hurry across the road, and hide. Looking down, one of them checks his wristwatch.\n\nCut to another wristwatch. Pull back to reveal the burly men who exited the car prior. They setup a roadblock to divert traffic, then rush onto the bridge to secure the heavy rope for the group’s escape.\n\nCut to the armored car approaching. The driver, an inside man, stops just before the bridge. The hidden men, now masked, spring into action. Guns drawn, they force their way inside the armored car and maneuver it across the bridge.\n\nCut to the Tower Bridge operator. Klaus Kinski sneaks up behind him, knocks him out, drags him back into the control booth, and raises the Tower Bridge.\n\nCut back to the armored car. With the roadblock diverting traffic on one end, and the raised bridge blocking traffic on the other, the thieves loot the armored car. Using the heavy rope, they zip the cash bags down to a boat waiting below.\n\nIt’s a terrific opening. Almost no dialog. Just crackerjack editing and great location photography. Granted, with no sign of a circus or top-billed Christopher Lee, one can imagine theater-goers in 1966 feeling confused. Did the projectionist queue the wrong movie? As if to assure them, the opening titles appear, backed by an oddly catchy theme.\n\nUnfortunately, the entire heist was a McGuffin. All the crooks except Kinski are killed. This was a British-German co-production and Kinski was big in Germany.\n\nThe setting shifts to the winter home of the Barberini circus. The pacing slows. Things get talky. Over twenty minutes in, Christopher Lee finally shows up. He plays Gregor, an enigmatic lion tamer who wears a black balaclava to mask his disfigurement. Leo Genn plays a police inspector poking around after the stolen money.\n\nFrom here, the movie devolves into an unremarkable whodunit. An unseen, knife-throwing assailant picks off potential suspects. There are lots of red herrings and at least one plot twist you’ll see coming.\n\nIt’s not a bad movie, but _Circus of Fear_ squanders the talent involved. Director John Moxey can build atmosphere (as the opening heist shows) but the convoluted plot gives him few opportunities. Christopher Lee spends much of his limited screen time wearing a ridiculous hood. And Klaus Kinski's post-heist role sees him reduced to lurking about in the shadows.\n\nIt’s frustrating. We may learn the killer’s identity, but the real mystery lies in what the principals could have done with better material.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"03 Aug 2014","grade":"D","slug":"the-bloody-judge-1970","sequence":"2","movie":{"title":"The Bloody Judge","runtimeMinutes":91,"originalTitle":"Il trono di fuoco","year":1970,"directors":[{"fullName":"Jesús Franco"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"The extras on _The Bloody Judge_ DVD are more interesting than the feature film.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nThe extras on _The Bloody Judge_ DVD are more interesting than the feature film.\n\nThe story takes place in England during the final days of King James II. Christopher Lee plays George Jeffreys, an infamous judge who meted out death sentences to suppress the burgeoning rebellion. These sham trials became known as the Bloody Assizes.\n\nIn the aforementioned DVD extras, Lee describes Jeffreys as a Jekyll-and-Hyde figure: a brilliant legal mind but also a merciless executioner. Had the film focused on this dichotomy, it might have worked.\n\nInstead, the film revolves around a fictitious love triangle. Jeffreys obsesses over Mary, a young peasant girl. Mary's lover, Harry, is part of the rebellion. Jeffreys longs to arrest Harry, but Harry's father is a political ally of Jeffreys. Instead, Jeffreys arrests Mary. Harry frees her. Jeffreys captures them both. They escape. Then the revolution happens.\n\nThere's also a blind oracle who may be psychic, and a man dressed like Boris Karloff in _The Tower of London (1939)_, torturing a semi-nude woman covered in Technicolor blood.\n\nThis mess of disparate plot-points has its roots in money. The production had multiple financiers, and each wanted a different film. One wanted a horror movie. Another wanted a historical drama. Yet another wanted an exploitation picture. The filmmakers tried to please everyone. At least no one wanted a comedy.\n\nThe resulting compromise boils down to a string of overlong, exposition-leaden scenes interrupted by occasional bits of exploitation. Things pick up when the revolution gets underway, but not enough to recapture our interest. I can forgive stiff dialog, convoluted plotting, gratuitous nudity and violence. I can't forgive boring.\n\nCompounding matters, Lee and director Jesús Franco disagreed on how to portray Jeffreys. Lee wanted historical accuracy. Franco wanted something more \"dynamic.\" I don't know what Franco meant by \"dynamic\" and, judging by his performance, Lee didn't either.\n\nConsider how Lee shifts his weight and looks uncomfortable whenever he sits down. In the DVD extras, Lee explains that Jeffreys suffered from kidney stones. Lee was a fine actor, but without script help, kidney stones is an impossible charade.\n\nThe financing amalgam also explains the myriad of alternate titles. In the United States it was _Night of the Blood Monster_. In England it was _Witch Killer of Broadmoor_, even though there's no Broadmoor in the film. Granted, there's no Blood Monster either, but why Broadmoor? That's one question the DVD extras couldn't answer.","backdrop":null}},{"date":"01 Jul 2014","grade":"C+","slug":"stake-land-2010","sequence":"1","movie":{"title":"Stake Land","runtimeMinutes":98,"originalTitle":"Stake Land","year":2010,"directors":[{"fullName":"Jim Mickle"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"In _Stake Land_ the bad guys use vampires like bombs, dropping them from helicopters.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nIn _Stake Land_ the bad guys use vampires like bombs, dropping them from helicopters.\n\nThe story unfolds in a near-future overrun by vamps (think fast-running-zombies, but vampires). Enigmatic loner Mister befriends orphaned teen Martin. They head out in Mister's old Cadillac, searching for the fabled sanctuary of New Eden. Along the way, they run up against a fundamentalist militia using vamps as weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIt plays more like a western than horror. After a grisly opening sequence where a vamp drains an infant, the film keeps its baddies off-screen as much as possible. Instead, it relies on scenery to build atmosphere. Deserted strip malls. Desolate two-lane blacktops. Overgrown buildings. Rusted scrapheaps. An urban wilderness.\n\nThe production values and supporting performances are better than the film's all but straight-to-video release would suggest. And the script features moments of genuine inspiration. When Martin hears his family is “already dead,” he accepts it with wisdom seldom seen in horror films.  And don't forget the part where the bad guys drop vampires from helicopters.\n\nBut _Stake Land_ isn't without its problems. The voice-over narration feels unnecessary. And I couldn't buy co-writer Nick Damici as Mister. His eyes betray the grizzled facade. Warren Oates would have been perfect, were he forty years younger and not dead.\n\nBut hey, did I mention the bad guys drop vampires from helicopters?","backdrop":null}}]},"more":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"limit":20,"skip":100,"numPages":6,"currentPage":6,"moreSkip":120,"moreLimit":4}}}
