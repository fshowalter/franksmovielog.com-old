Christopher Lee plays George Jeffreys, an infamous judge who meted out death sentences to suppress the burgeoning rebellion. These sham trials became known as the Bloody Assizes.\n\nIn the aforementioned DVD extras, Lee describes Jeffreys as a Jekyll-and-Hyde figure: a brilliant legal mind but also a merciless executioner. Had the film focused on this dichotomy, it might have worked.\n\nInstead, the film revolves around a fictitious love triangle. Jeffreys obsesses over Mary, a young peasant girl. Mary's lover, Harry, is part of the rebellion. Jeffreys longs to arrest Harry, but Harry's father is a political ally of Jeffreys. Instead, Jeffreys arrests Mary. Harry frees her. Jeffreys captures them both. They escape. Then the revolution happens.\n\nThere's also a blind oracle who may be psychic, and a man dressed like Boris Karloff in _The Tower of London (1939)_, torturing a semi-nude woman covered in Technicolor blood.\n\nThis mess of disparate plot-points has its roots in money. The production had multiple financiers, and each wanted a different film. One wanted a horror movie. Another wanted a historical drama. Yet another wanted an exploitation picture. The filmmakers tried to please everyone. At least no one wanted a comedy.\n\nThe resulting compromise boils down to a string of overlong, exposition-leaden scenes interrupted by occasional bits of exploitation. Things pick up when the revolution gets underway, but not enough to recapture our interest. I can forgive stiff dialog, convoluted plotting, gratuitous nudity and violence. I can't forgive boring.\n\nCompounding matters, Lee and director Jesús Franco disagreed on how to portray Jeffreys. Lee wanted historical accuracy. Franco wanted something more \"dynamic.\" I don't know what Franco meant by \"dynamic\" and, judging by his performance, Lee didn't either.\n\nConsider how Lee shifts his weight and looks uncomfortable whenever he sits down. In the DVD extras, Lee explains that Jeffreys suffered from kidney stones. Lee was a fine actor, but without script help, kidney stones is an impossible charade.\n\nThe financing amalgam also explains the myriad of alternate titles. In the United States it was _Night of the Blood Monster_. In England it was _Witch Killer of Broadmoor_, even though there's no Broadmoor in the film. Granted, there's no Blood Monster either, but why Broadmoor? That's one question the DVD extras couldn't answer.","backdrop":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"the-bloody-judge-1970","backdrop":"the-bloody-judge-1970.png"}}}
