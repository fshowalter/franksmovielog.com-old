This may not be the film's most ridiculous scene.\n\nThis was the second production, following _Haunted Gold (1932)_, under a six-picture contract John Wayne signed with Warner Bros. It’s a remake of _The Unknown Cavalier (1926)_.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. acquired First National Pictures a few years prior, they inherited the rights to several silent westerns starring Ken Maynard. These were popular, A-list productions featuring Maynard’s impressive stunt work.\n\nWarner Bros. sought to remake the Maynard silents with sound, recycling as much footage as possible, reshooting only the close-ups and interiors. All they needed was an actor who matched Maynard’s build. Enter Wayne.\n\nWayne plays a wandering cowboy who tries to apprehend a mysterious outlaw known as The Hawk, only to end up framed for the outlaw's crimes.\n\nThe opening sequence reveals The Hawk's identity, so there's no mystery. It also telegraphs the finale by introducing someone who can identify The Hawk. Granted, said person lies comatose but, as the doctor says, “He'll be fine.”\n\nThis absurdity continues to the aforementioned horse trial, through Wayne's introduction, and to his framing. This consists of The Hawk dropping Wayne's monogrammed harmonica after raiding a homestead. That's all the town needs to lynch Wayne. As they say, “We've got incontrovertible proof.”\n\nAnd yet, despite the inanity, or perhaps because of it, the script surprises. When the female lead finds herself surrounded by The Hawk's gang, she isn’t captured. Instead, she displays surprising wit and actually rescues Wayne. It's only _later_ that she’s captured.\n\nAs for Wayne, he's still learning. You catch glimpses of his iconic persona, such as his reaction shots during his sham trial, but they're rare.","backdrop":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ride-him-cowboy-1932","backdrop":"ride-him-cowboy-1932.png"}}}
