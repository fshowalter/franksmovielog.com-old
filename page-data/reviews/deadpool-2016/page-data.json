Just as he meets the girl of his dreams and finds the happiness that's eluded him all his life, Wade learns he's developed terminal cancer. A mysterious organization reaches out with the promise of a cure. Wade accepts, but the cure carries at a steep price. Presumed dead, Wade embarks on a mission of vengeance, complete with running color commentary.\n\n_Deadpool_ plays as a self-aware comic book film. The first time I watched it, I laughed so hard I missed most of the jokes. Besides the non-stop non-sequiturs, we get jokes about the plot, jokes about the other _X-Men_ films, and jokes about the limited budget. They're not belittling the genre, just mining it for laughs.\n\nAnd these laughs come wrapped in a solid origin story. The film invests time in Wade and his relationships, making him more than a clown.\n\nMost of the credit goes to Reynolds. His deadpan comedy proves the perfect match for the character's gallows humor. He doesn't just carry the film, he propels it along with his considerable charisma. This despite having essentially a voice-over role for most of his scenes.\n\nIt's said one can mark a genre's end when it devolves into comedy, as _Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)_ ended the Universal Monster era. But that needn't be the case. Rather than transplant genre characters into a comedic film, _Deadpool_ takes a genre film and adds liberal doses of comedy. It's a subtle but important distinction. _Deadpool_ may be hilarious, but it's a comic book movie first, and a comedy second.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/9b7de/deadpool-2016.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/eb003/deadpool-2016.jpg 200w,\n/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/11f33/deadpool-2016.jpg 400w,\n/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/9b7de/deadpool-2016.jpg 800w,\n/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/29626/deadpool-2016.jpg 1200w,\n/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/0a886/deadpool-2016.jpg 1600w,\n/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/032f3/deadpool-2016.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"deadpool-2016","backdrop":"deadpool-2016.png"}}}
