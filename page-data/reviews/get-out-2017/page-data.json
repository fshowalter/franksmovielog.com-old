Bear with me.\n\nDaniel Kaluuya stars as Chris, a young photographer. Chris's girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), takes him home to meet her parents at their remote estate. Chris is apprehensive because Rose hasn't told her family he's black. She assures him everything will be fine. Everything is not fine.\n\nForgive my not revealing more but, as Roger Ebert often said, it's not what the film is about, but how it is about it. With _Get Out_, writer/director Jordan Peele offers a horror film that's a meditation on racism in America, but not how you'd expect. Every time I thought I knew where he was going, Peele surprised me.\n\nThis extends to the execution. Horror films sink or swim based on how they handle the tropes. The best filmmakers define, perfect, upend, or avoid them. Peele embraces them.\n\nAllow me to spoil a single scene to make my point. It's the middle of the night. Chris has endured a rough day with Rose's family. He's tired, on edge, and can't sleep. He sneaks out for a cigarette. Outside he seesâ€”wait, I changed my mind. I can't spoil the scene; it's too good. But consider how Peele embraces the trope of drawing the protagonist into a spooky situation. Chris doesn't investigate an odd noise, or similar clunky idiot plot behavior, his motives feel organic. As for what he sees, well, it's scary, bizarre and humorous all at once. Peele leverages the setup's inherent suspense and channels it into an original payoff. It's genre Aikido.\n\nIndeed, aside from Rose's brother's part feeling underwritten or severely edited, the film shines. It's not until the third act, when the film's cards are on the table, that it falters. We've grown so enamored with Peele's ability to repurpose the genre's staples, that it feels like a letdown when he indulges in a few.\n\nOn this point, I'm torn. I love the third act's gleefully gory, over the top nature, but it feels like a safety net. Like a comedian following a raw emotional truth with a punchline. The finale plays well, but Peele earned a darker, more honest ending.\n\nI can't wait to see what he does next.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/9b7de/get-out-2017.jpg","srcSet":"/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/eb003/get-out-2017.jpg 200w,\n/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/11f33/get-out-2017.jpg 400w,\n/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/9b7de/get-out-2017.jpg 800w,\n/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/29626/get-out-2017.jpg 1200w,\n/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/0a886/get-out-2017.jpg 1600w,\n/static/59601ce82d0339cd8a915509d842424c/032f3/get-out-2017.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"get-out-2017","backdrop":"get-out-2017.png"}}}
