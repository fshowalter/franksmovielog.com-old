Brie Larson plays the intermediary. As the deal goes down, a grunt in one gang squabbles with a grunt the other gang, escalating into a full-fledged melee. Amid the flying bullets, the script weaves in some double-crosses. But honestly? The details escape me. _Free Fire_ isn’t concerned with plot, but style.\n\nAnd it’s got style to spare. The clothes, the hair, the set decoration—this movie does the impossible: it makes 1978 look cool. Do they give Academy Awards for that? They should.\n\nBut as much as I enjoyed the film’s look, the execution frustrated me. When the firefight breaks out, director Ben Wheatley offers no sense of geography. Folks shoot and scramble for cover but we have no sense of their placement in relation to one another. A few wide shots would have sufficed. Disorient characters, not the audience.\n\nStill, it almost doesn’t matter. The dialog held my ear, and despite little plot or characterization, the cast—particularly Hammer—grabbed my attention through sheer charisma. _Free Fire_ isn’t a good movie, but it’s as good an okay movie as you’ll find.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/1bdada54a2038deda31a5975430e5dc8/9b7de/free-fire-2016.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1bdada54a2038deda31a5975430e5dc8/eb003/free-fire-2016.jpg 200w,\n/static/1bdada54a2038deda31a5975430e5dc8/11f33/free-fire-2016.jpg 400w,\n/static/1bdada54a2038deda31a5975430e5dc8/9b7de/free-fire-2016.jpg 800w,\n/static/1bdada54a2038deda31a5975430e5dc8/29626/free-fire-2016.jpg 1200w,\n/static/1bdada54a2038deda31a5975430e5dc8/0a886/free-fire-2016.jpg 1600w,\n/static/1bdada54a2038deda31a5975430e5dc8/032f3/free-fire-2016.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"free-fire-2016","backdrop":"free-fire-2016.png"}}}
