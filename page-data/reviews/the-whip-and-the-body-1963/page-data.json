He plays Kurt, a young nobleman returning to his ancestral castle after some time away.\n\nWe learn Kurt has something of a notorious reputation and the castle is full of people wishing to do him harm. Soon Kurt is dead under mysterious circumstances, and his ghost is stalking the castle, claiming those who might have killed him.\n\nThere’s also Nevenka, once Kurt’s fiancée, now married to his younger brother. She claims to hate Kurt, but her reactions to his whip say otherwise.\n\nEvery frame in _The Whip and The Body_ drips gothic atmosphere. The castle interiors are all blue-green hues mixed with inky shadows across stone walls and floors. Think of the old Universal Monster sets brought to glorious technicolor life.\n\nBut where those pictures may have hinted or implied sexual overtones, _The Whip and the Body_ is overt. Kurt flogs Nevenka and she likes it. By injecting a liberal dose of sex and violence, the film rejuvenates the haunted castle story.\n\nThe film’s only misstep lies in it’s overbearing, generic score. It sounds like something out of a soap opera, not the eerie, haunting soundtrack the film deserves.","backdrop":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"the-whip-and-the-body-1963","backdrop":"the-whip-and-the-body-1963.png"}}}
