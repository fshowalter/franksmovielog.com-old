How refreshing.\n\nMacon Blair stars as Dwight, a drifter living in a rusted car on the Delaware coast. When he learns his parents' murderer is receiving an early parole, he returns to his small Virginia hometown to exact revenge.\n\n_Blue Ruin_ doesn't settle for revenge movie tropes. Dwight isn't confident and driven. He's desperate and scared. He exacts his revenge in a clumsy and brutal bit of violence that leaves him bloody and shaken. His escape proves equally sloppy, leaving him to await the inevitable retaliation.\n\nRoger Ebert was fond of saying, \"It's not what the movie is about, but how it is about it,\" and that's true of _Blue Ruin_. It's a simple story, but I loved its straightforward, character-driven, approach. We meet Dwight as he's easing into a warm bath inside a cozy single family home. Just as he gets comfortable, the owners arrive and Dwight flees. It's a terrific introduction that draws us into his story. As Dwight's retribution spirals out of control, we grow concerned for him, investing us in the finale.\n\nBlair is perfect in the role. He never tells us how Dwight is feeling, but his eyes speak volumes. As Dwight watches his parents' killer leave prison, Blair's expression mirrors the bile and nausea churning in Dwight's stomach. Later, after Dwight has taken his revenge, Blair's darting gaze and vacant eyes communicate Dwight's shock. It's an award-worthy performance.\n\nThe film has its flaws: a bit of on-the-nose dialog and a suspect backstory, but these are minor quibbles. _Blue Ruin_ is that rarest of thrillers, one that places its characters first.","backdrop":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"blue-ruin-2013","backdrop":"blue-ruin-2013.png"}}}
