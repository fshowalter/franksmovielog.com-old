It's about the bitter dissolution of a marriage. There are… _other_ details, but we'll get to them later.\n\nFirst, I shall attempt to convey a sense of the viewing experience. If you've seen the film, I can hear you laughing.\n\nThe opening sequences assault you. Mark, played by Sam Neill, returns home to West Berlin and discovers his wife Anna, played by Isabelle Adjani, has checked out of their marriage. Neill and Adjani over-emote in performances ripped from a daytime soap opera. And yet, their scenes with their kindergarten-age son, Bob, feel restrained and true. The contrast holds your interest, as does the mystery of Mark's job. The indirect way he talks to his employers and their responses hint at clandestine—even sinister—origins.\n\nAs the film marches on, the stakes rise. Mark moves out and spirals into an obsessive mania. When he visits some days later, Mark finds Bob alone and neglected. He moves back in and Anna disappears. In search of Anna, Mark confronts her new lover, gets bloodied, and returns home. There he discovers Anna, who won't divulge where she's been. Frustrated, Mark beats her.\n\nSo far, I've been cagey with the film's plot points. What follows crosses into spoiler territory. Director Andrzej Żuławski's film is a nihilistic Gordian knot of symbolism presented as psychological horror. It's not that I'm not sure what the film is about; I'm not sure how the film is about it.\n\nAnna has been disappearing to a derelict apartment where she copulates with a squid-like tentacled monster. This… _thing_ exhibits powerful psychic abilities, possessing the mind of anyone around it.\n\nThe monster requires human flesh (or blood?) to grow, leading Anna to murder a series of interlopers, including her former lover, and a detective hired by Mark.\n\nOnce the bodies pile up, the film catches up to Neill and Adjani's performances. Now their manic behavior feels appropriate. It's a subtle trick I didn't catch until my second viewing. Watching _Possession_ in a theater, the audience—full of wry snickers early on—sat riveted in silence by this point.\n\nAnd I haven't mentioned Anna's doppelgänger or the scene where Anna—oozing blood and slime from every orifice—miscarries the tentacle monster's offspring in a deserted subway corridor.\n\nWhat is Żuławski saying? Between the talk of God and reoccurring shots of the Berlin Wall, _Possession_ remains a mystery. One that sticks with me for days. Is it the mix of nihilism and the supernatural? Perhaps. Regardless, though I may not know why it resonates, I can't deny that it does.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/5926cb48e6f516eada5cf2d96ce59d50/9b7de/possession-1981.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5926cb48e6f516eada5cf2d96ce59d50/eb003/possession-1981.jpg 200w,\n/static/5926cb48e6f516eada5cf2d96ce59d50/11f33/possession-1981.jpg 400w,\n/static/5926cb48e6f516eada5cf2d96ce59d50/9b7de/possession-1981.jpg 800w,\n/static/5926cb48e6f516eada5cf2d96ce59d50/29626/possession-1981.jpg 1200w,\n/static/5926cb48e6f516eada5cf2d96ce59d50/0a886/possession-1981.jpg 1600w,\n/static/5926cb48e6f516eada5cf2d96ce59d50/032f3/possession-1981.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"14 Aug 2017","grade":"F","slug":"the-sister-of-ursula-1978","sequence":"102","movie":{"title":"The Sister of Ursula","runtimeMinutes":96,"originalTitle":"La sorella di Ursula","year":1978,"directors":[{"fullName":"Enzo Milioni"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"Part soft-core porn.

As the film opens, they're checking into a luxury hotel on the Italian coast. Ursula begs Dagmar to leave, claiming visions of a horrible future. With heavy sighs, Dagmar dismisses Ursula's pleadings. Ursula pouts. Instead of establishing a forbidding atmosphere, the scene left me cold to Ursula's petulant behavior. \n\nDagmar convinces Ursula to accompany her to the hotel nightclub. There we meet the supporting players: the hotel manager, a sultry nightclub singer, and a pretty-boy gigolo. Dagmar feels a connection to the gigolo, but Ursula insists he's dangerous. More sighs and dismissals from Dagmar.\n\nAs the film goes on, a pattern emerges. The script introduces either a character who has sex with a supporting player or a pair of characters who have sex with each other. A mysterious black-gloved figure watches the copulating couple from the shadows. After some late-night-cable-grade soft-core erotica, the black-gloved figure kills one or both of the lovers. Aside from a slashed throat, the violence occurs off-screen. \n\nThe script offers few red herrings. Instead, it doles out assorted subplots including the sisters' search for their estranged mother, the hotel manager's struggles with his estranged wife, and the gigolo's drug habit. \n\nNone of these threads held my interest. But the film's reputation as a sleazy giallo had me certain it would veer into crazy territory. \n\nIt proved a long wait. During the finale, after an unsurprising reveal of the killer's identity, we see the murder weapon. Spoiler—it's a giant phallus. Seeing the killer advance, phallus in hand, was just the sort of crazy I'd been expecting. But this scene doesn't justify the hour-and-a-half investment. I've said it before, but it bears repeating. I can forgive a movie many things. Bad acting? Specious plotting? Gratuitous nudity? I can overlook them all. But I can't forgive boring.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAgGBgcGBQgHBwcJCQgKDBQNDAsLDBkSEw8UHRofHh0aHBwgJC4nICIsIxwcKDcpLDAxNDQ0Hyc5PTgyPC4zNDL/2wBDAQkJCQwLDBgNDRgyIRwhMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjIyMjL/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwb/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAP/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABwcqwkMT/xAAYEAACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRIP/aAAgBAQABBQJUJRz/AP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8BP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABkQAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACAhcf/aAAgBAQAGPwLSoWeV/8QAGxABAAEFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASEAESAxQVH/2gAIAQEAAT8hLXk8prdkMDbj/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABALH//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAR/9oACAEDAQE/EKf/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/ED//xAAaEAEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEVEAICFB/9oACAEBAAE/EDZRJEl3wwrOGU9A0Ov/2Q==","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/6040b48fe248d3d8b175462075b629a7/9b7de/the-sister-of-ursula-1978.jpg","srcSet":"/static/6040b48fe248d3d8b175462075b629a7/eb003/the-sister-of-ursula-1978.jpg 200w,\n/static/6040b48fe248d3d8b175462075b629a7/11f33/the-sister-of-ursula-1978.jpg 400w,\n/static/6040b48fe248d3d8b175462075b629a7/9b7de/the-sister-of-ursula-1978.jpg 800w,\n/static/6040b48fe248d3d8b175462075b629a7/29626/the-sister-of-ursula-1978.jpg 1200w,\n/static/6040b48fe248d3d8b175462075b629a7/0a886/the-sister-of-ursula-1978.jpg 1600w,\n/static/6040b48fe248d3d8b175462075b629a7/032f3/the-sister-of-ursula-1978.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"07 Aug 2017","grade":"A+","slug":"rio-bravo-1959","sequence":"101","movie":{"title":"Rio Bravo","runtimeMinutes":141,"originalTitle":"Rio Bravo","year":1959,"directors":[{"fullName":"Howard Hawks"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_Rio Bravo_ is my favorite movie but I can't imagine how to review it. ","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_Rio Bravo_ is my favorite movie but I can't imagine how to review it. \n\nThis marks my 101st review since relaunching this site in 2014. Prior to that, I strove to review every film I saw. Keeping pace with my movie-watching habit meant cranking out reviews at a relentless pace. \n\nWith the relaunch, I focused on quality over quantity. A good review describes the film and the experience watching it. As Roger Ebert said:\n\n> In other words, if it is a Pauly Shore comedy, there are people who like them, and they should be able to discover in your review if the new one is down to their usual standard.\n\nThat's the goal. A cursory look through my last 100 reviews reveals ample failures. Good writers show rather than tell. Too often, I present my opinion as fact instead of building a case for the reader to arrive at the same conclusion. \n\n\nConsider this line, from my review of _Maléfique (2002)_:\n\n> As Carrère, Gérald Laroche provides a grounded audience surrogate whose gradual transformation into a bitter convict carries the film.\n\nWhat does that mean? How does it carry the film?\n\nOr this bit, from my review of _Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961)_:\n\n> Patricia Neal plays the rich, married woman who pays Paul's rent and keeps him in nice clothes. She makes an impression by underplaying her role.\n\nHow does she underplay the role?\n\nOr from my review of _Giallo a Venezia (1979)_:\n\n> The murders—particularly the prostitute's—are uninspired and ugly.\n\nWhat makes them uninspired and ugly? I'm not describing the murders, I'm describing my reaction to them, but not calling that out as opinion.\n\nAnd consider the outright nonsense I've written, like the closing line from my review of _Interstellar (2014)_:\n\n> Interstellar doesn’t transcend the science fiction genre, it abandons it.\n\nLines like that make me wonder if I'm wasting my time. True, practice makes perfect, but practice requires feedback.\n\nStephen King writes for his wife. My wife provides great feedback but I have to petition her to read my work. She doesn't like my style. I could take that as feedback in itself, but I've read reviews she _does_ enjoy and _I_ don't like them. \n\nI've tried soliciting feedback via comments. The few replies I received spoke to my opinions, not the writing itself. Fair enough, considering the site's homepage receives little traffic compared to the individual reviews. \n\nIt's time I admit it: Constant Reader, you don't exist.\n\nSo why bother? \n\nI ask myself that a lot.\n\nThe answer is my daughters. Neither is old enough to read, but they're my audience. At least, their future selves. At my current pace, I'll have written several hundred reviews by the time they're old enough to watch R-rated movies. By the time they're my age, statistics say I'll be dead. \n\nWhich makes my failures as a writer all the more painful. But I still have time. Tomorrow's rewrite can fix today's shortfall. Provided I solve the feedback problem. \n\nBut back to _Rio Bravo_.\n\nJohn Wayne stars as John T. Chance, sheriff of Presidio County, Texas. He's holding Joe Burdette for murder. Joe's brother, Nathan, is a wealthy land baron. Nathan recruits a slew of mercenaries to free Joe. Chance's allies consist of his drunken deputy Dude, played by Dean Martin, a crippled old curmudgeon named Stumpy, played by Walter Brennan, a young gunslinger named Colorado, played by Ricky Nelson, and a showgirl turned gambler named Feathers, played by Angie Dickinson. \n\nThe script establishes the premise in the first ten minutes, with almost no dialog. From there, the film unfolds at a languid pace. There are flashes of action, but much of the film sees the cast sitting or standing around indoors, talking or reacting to one-another.\n\nHere is where I falter. I'm not sure why the film works so well. I can point to the charisma of Wayne and Martin, but that's only part of it. The film speaks to something deeper. A good chunk of the film revolves around Chance rehabilitating Dude. Chance doesn't coddle him, but it's not \"tough love\" either. Chance believes Dude will come around. For Dude, the desire to live up to that faith is stronger than any addiction.\n\nIt's a wonderful male fantasy, and for two hours and change, we believe it. Chance is an idealized big-brother/father figure. He's the strong, honest, capable, professional man we want to be. Dude is the flawed, vulnerable man we feel we are. Chance's faith in Dude is Chance's faith in us. Watching _Rio Bravo_ is a low-key cathartic experience. The most powerful scenes are wordless or book-ended with comic relief. It's not a heavy film, but it punches above its weight.\n\nAnd about the comic relief. Much of it comes via Walter Brennan's character, but repeat viewings have lent a comedic shade to many of Wayne's lines. Like Billy Wilder's best films, _Rio Bravo_ uses comedy as a subtle distraction. When Chance says, \"Sorry don't get it done Dude,\" we smirk at the delivery but feel the message.\n\nI'm closing in on a thousand words and I haven't touched on Angie Dickinson's performance or Dimitri Tiomkin's score. I could devote a couple hundred words to each and not do them justice.\n\nIndeed, one could write a book analyzing the film but I suspect only the author would enjoy it. _Rio Bravo_ taps into emotions it never acknowledges. We interpret the undercurrents based on our own experiences. Over-explaining things would force a singular interpretation and alienate the reader. \n\nOr maybe I'm trying to justify my shortcomings as a writer. \n\nYou tell me.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/fcebe4b6b4be5df958898032ef7c8bbe/9b7de/rio-bravo-1959.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fcebe4b6b4be5df958898032ef7c8bbe/eb003/rio-bravo-1959.jpg 200w,\n/static/fcebe4b6b4be5df958898032ef7c8bbe/11f33/rio-bravo-1959.jpg 400w,\n/static/fcebe4b6b4be5df958898032ef7c8bbe/9b7de/rio-bravo-1959.jpg 800w,\n/static/fcebe4b6b4be5df958898032ef7c8bbe/29626/rio-bravo-1959.jpg 1200w,\n/static/fcebe4b6b4be5df958898032ef7c8bbe/0a886/rio-bravo-1959.jpg 1600w,\n/static/fcebe4b6b4be5df958898032ef7c8bbe/032f3/rio-bravo-1959.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"17 Jul 2017","grade":"B","slug":"my-bloody-valentine-1981","sequence":"100","movie":{"title":"My Bloody Valentine","runtimeMinutes":90,"originalTitle":"My Bloody Valentine","year":1981,"directors":[{"fullName":"George Mihalka"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"_My Bloody Valentine_ proves you can defy the tropes while still staying true to the genre.","rawMarkdownBody":"\n_My Bloody Valentine_ proves you can defy the tropes while still staying true to the genre.\n\nThe plot is vintage 80's slasher. Years earlier, a small Nova Scotian mining town saw a cave-in trap several miners. The men on watch were AWOL at a Valentine's Day party, forcing the lone survivor to resort to cannibalism. Following his rescue, the survivor donned his mining gear and murdered the negligent men. The town hasn't celebrated Valentine's Day since.\n\nFlash-forward. A fresh group of young miners and their girlfriends want to have a Valentine's Day party. Unbeknownst to them, someone wearing a miner's outfit has begun offing locals. The mayor and sheriff keep the killings under wraps and cancel the party. The frustrated miners move the party to the mine. Soon, the youngsters find themselves trapped underground with the killer.\n\nLike _Friday the 13th (1980)_, the story revolves around a tragedy of neglect born of indulgence. In a subtle nod, the film sets Valentine's Day on a Saturday, making the preceding Friday the 13th. Like _Halloween (1978)_ it features a holiday theme. But _My Bloody Valentine_ eschews wooded cabins or suburban homes and substitutes a dank, dark, coal mine. It's an inspired choice that works thanks to the location photography. Another inspired choice is the script's allowance for multiple survivors. By avoiding the \"final girl\" trope, the film avoids the contrived plotting that goes into whittling a group, despite the natural human impulse to stick together.\n\nIndeed, as an 80's slasher, the only things working against the film are the Nova Scotian accents. To me, they sound too cheerful and polite, giving the film an unintentional satirical tone.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/4c96db4f133373ff8aa1f7173fc7521d/9b7de/my-bloody-valentine-1981.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4c96db4f133373ff8aa1f7173fc7521d/eb003/my-bloody-valentine-1981.jpg 200w,\n/static/4c96db4f133373ff8aa1f7173fc7521d/11f33/my-bloody-valentine-1981.jpg 400w,\n/static/4c96db4f133373ff8aa1f7173fc7521d/9b7de/my-bloody-valentine-1981.jpg 800w,\n/static/4c96db4f133373ff8aa1f7173fc7521d/29626/my-bloody-valentine-1981.jpg 1200w,\n/static/4c96db4f133373ff8aa1f7173fc7521d/0a886/my-bloody-valentine-1981.jpg 1600w,\n/static/4c96db4f133373ff8aa1f7173fc7521d/032f3/my-bloody-valentine-1981.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"10 Jul 2017","grade":"C+","slug":"harry-in-your-pocket-1973","sequence":"99","movie":{"title":"Harry in Your Pocket","runtimeMinutes":103,"originalTitle":"Harry in Your Pocket","year":1973,"directors":[{"fullName":"Bruce Geller"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"Every so often, a film works despite not working.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nEvery so often, a film works despite not working.\n\nIn _Harry in Your Pocket_, James Coburn plays the titular Harry, a professional pick-pocket. He operates with Casey, an aging crook played by Walter Pidgeon. The plot follows a young couple who join Harry and Casey to form a wire mob.\n\nA wire mob is an organized team of pick-pockets. Though we never learn the mechanics of pick-pocketing, we learn the lingo. A spotter directs stalls to distract the mark for the cannon who passes the poke to the drop.\n\nThe gang travels from Seattle up to British Columbia then down to Salt Lake City. They board in the finest hotels and dine in the finest restaurants, their lifestyle financed by Harry via strangers' wallets. I appreciated the elegant way the film presented the bleak truth: what can Harry do with the money but spend it?\n\nTo that end, Coburn's Harry proves an enigma. We learn little about him yet he remains relentlessly interesting.\n\nThe trouble is, the film isn't about Harry, it's about Ray and Sandy, the young stalls who join Harry's gang. Thanks to Trish Van Devere's performance, I could buy Sandy as a detached thrill seeker, but Michael Sarrazin's performance as Ray left me impatient.\n\nDevoid of any edge, Sarrazin plays Ray as a generic nice guy who'd prefer a 9-to-5 job and a house in the suburbs. When Ray's alone on screen, the film drags. \n\nStill, I liked the movie. Chalk it up to Coburn. He's so interesting to watch, he makes mediocre movies good, and good movies great. _Harry in Your Pocket_ is closer to mediocre, but Coburn makes it worthwhile.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/4c0e6e73a06813cb293a59c710dd5e4d/9b7de/harry-in-your-pocket-1973.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4c0e6e73a06813cb293a59c710dd5e4d/eb003/harry-in-your-pocket-1973.jpg 200w,\n/static/4c0e6e73a06813cb293a59c710dd5e4d/11f33/harry-in-your-pocket-1973.jpg 400w,\n/static/4c0e6e73a06813cb293a59c710dd5e4d/9b7de/harry-in-your-pocket-1973.jpg 800w,\n/static/4c0e6e73a06813cb293a59c710dd5e4d/29626/harry-in-your-pocket-1973.jpg 1200w,\n/static/4c0e6e73a06813cb293a59c710dd5e4d/0a886/harry-in-your-pocket-1973.jpg 1600w,\n/static/4c0e6e73a06813cb293a59c710dd5e4d/032f3/harry-in-your-pocket-1973.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"03 Jul 2017","grade":"B+","slug":"the-thin-man-1934","sequence":"98","movie":{"title":"The Thin Man","runtimeMinutes":91,"originalTitle":"The Thin Man","year":1934,"directors":[{"fullName":"W.S.

He's interrupted by a visit from his daughter Dorothy who announces her engagement. \n\nWynant hurries Dorothy out but promises to return in time for her wedding. Wynant continues his preparations but finds the $50,000 in bonds he'd earmarked as a wedding present to Dorothy have gone missing. \n\nWynant storms over to his mistress Julia's apartment and catches her in another man's arms. Wynant accuses Julia of stealing the bonds and threatens to turn her over to the police. \n\nThree months later, Dorothy hasn't heard from her father. While out at a restaurant, she recognizes former detective Nick Charles, played by William Powell, and approaches him for help. Nick declines, citing his new life of leisure with his heiress wife Nora, played by Myrna Loy. \n\nBut when circumstances pin a pair of murders on the still missing Wynant, Nick steps in, uncovering a buried skeleton and a labyrinthine array of suspects and motives. The mystery culminates with New York's finest corralling everyone to a dinner party where Nick reveals the true killer. \n\nThe talky opening betrays the film's B-movie production. It's a stiff ten minutes but don't worry. Once Powell makes his appearance—in a posh bar showing an impromptu crowd how various cocktails demand unique shaking rhythms (Manhattans a Fox-Trot, Bronxs a Two-Step, and Dry Martinis a Waltz)—everything changes. The dialog shifts from stilted exposition to witty banter as Powell glides through the film as the witty urbane charmer we believe ourselves to be after a few drinks. \n\nThe script offers little real danger and the entire plot proves little more than a MacGuffin to support his lyrical banter, which reaches its apex during the iconic dinner party scene. As Nora says, “It's the best dinner I've ever listened to.”","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/06dd7a82899b7f6d441dfcb3689301f6/9b7de/the-thin-man-1934.jpg","srcSet":"/static/06dd7a82899b7f6d441dfcb3689301f6/eb003/the-thin-man-1934.jpg 200w,\n/static/06dd7a82899b7f6d441dfcb3689301f6/11f33/the-thin-man-1934.jpg 400w,\n/static/06dd7a82899b7f6d441dfcb3689301f6/9b7de/the-thin-man-1934.jpg 800w,\n/static/06dd7a82899b7f6d441dfcb3689301f6/29626/the-thin-man-1934.jpg 1200w,\n/static/06dd7a82899b7f6d441dfcb3689301f6/0a886/the-thin-man-1934.jpg 1600w,\n/static/06dd7a82899b7f6d441dfcb3689301f6/032f3/the-thin-man-1934.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"26 Jun 2017","grade":"D+","slug":"his-private-secretary-1933","sequence":"97","movie":{"title":"His Private Secretary","runtimeMinutes":60,"originalTitle":"His Private Secretary","year":1933,"directors":[{"fullName":"Phil Whitman"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"Foreshadowing a career playing characters with great names, John Wayne plays a wealthy socialite named Dick Wallace.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nForeshadowing a career playing characters with great names, John Wayne plays a wealthy socialite named Dick Wallace.\n\nAfter chewing him out for being a drunken womanizer, Wallace's father puts him to work collecting a debt owed by a minister.

","rawMarkdownBody":"\nI have a soft-spot for over-the-top exploitation films, but not mean-spirited ones. \n\nA few months back, I gave _Island of Death (1977)_ a four-star review, praising its “everything-but-the-kitchen sink approach that pushes the film past any genuine scares or mean-spirited umbrage, and firmly into parody.” _Giallo a Venezia_ opens with a similar vibe. \n\nWe meet an improbably coiffed police detective inspecting the murder of a married couple, Fabio and Flavia. \n\nAs the case unwinds, we learn Fabio was a sex fiend. In a series of flashbacks, he pushes Flavia to engage in escalating deviant behavior. First simple voyeurism, but soon he's whipping her, encouraging strangers to grope her, and her to grope strangers. \n\nThe whipping bit had me laughing. The scene starts with Fabio and Flavia in bed. She tries to engage him, kissing and fondling him, but he's bored and soon retires to another room where he thumbs through a book of erotic drawings. Still looking at the drawings, Fabio snorts a sizable amount of cocaine. The combination enacts a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transformation that sees him return to Flavia, cat-o-nine-tails in hand, and wail on her. She screams which only excites him further, and soon he's forcing himself into an uncomfortable place. Played straight, the scene would be painful, but it's so over-the-top, it's hard to take seriously. \n\nBut instead of embracing the ridiculous, the film doubles down on misogyny. A mysterious killer offs a prostitute and some friends of Fabio and Flavia. The murders—particularly the prostitute's—are uninspired and ugly. The film gets progressively meaner, culminating in a gang-rape scene I found hard to watch. _Giallo a Venezia_ isn't crazy enough to entertain and lacks any thoughts to provoke. It's just rubbing our noses in a series of obnoxious scenes it believes pass for edgy drama.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/c6e19af40bd5e2ef0bf824232a7b8d2d/9b7de/giallo-a-venezia-1979.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c6e19af40bd5e2ef0bf824232a7b8d2d/eb003/giallo-a-venezia-1979.jpg 200w,\n/static/c6e19af40bd5e2ef0bf824232a7b8d2d/11f33/giallo-a-venezia-1979.jpg 400w,\n/static/c6e19af40bd5e2ef0bf824232a7b8d2d/9b7de/giallo-a-venezia-1979.jpg 800w,\n/static/c6e19af40bd5e2ef0bf824232a7b8d2d/29626/giallo-a-venezia-1979.jpg 1200w,\n/static/c6e19af40bd5e2ef0bf824232a7b8d2d/0a886/giallo-a-venezia-1979.jpg 1600w,\n/static/c6e19af40bd5e2ef0bf824232a7b8d2d/032f3/giallo-a-venezia-1979.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"12 Jun 2017","grade":"F","slug":"the-ghoul-1933","sequence":"95","movie":{"title":"The Ghoul","runtimeMinutes":77,"originalTitle":"The Ghoul","year":1933,"directors":[{"fullName":"T.

It's a good setup, and the funeral scene that follows has us pumped for some undead action. \n\nBut these scenes appear tacked on to capitalize on Karloff's prior box office successes: _The Mummy (1932)_ and _The Old Dark House (1932)_. \n\nDespite the title, _The Ghoul_ isn't a horror film. With Karloff off-screen, the film devolves into a tedious mystery. A slew of characters turn up searching for a rare jewel stolen from Karloff's tomb. \n\nWith the supporting cast's flat delivery and stiff dialog, following the convoluted plot proves an ordeal.

It wasn't a rental store, but one that sold VHS and Laserdisc movies.\n\nOn monitors mounted throughout the store we'd show whatever clamshelled, family-friendly title corporate was pushing—think _Free Willy (1993)_. \n\nDuring the holiday season, corporate would ship washing-machine-sized boxes of product for us to stock. Nothing stayed in the back room so we'd be there—well past midnight—stacking copies of _The Bodyguard (1992)_ and _Sister Act (1992)_.\n\nWhile we worked, we'd put on a movie. The monitors would be off, but we'd listen. _Casablanca_ proved an employee favorite on those long nights. Though I'd never seen it, I loved the crackling dialog:\n\n>It would take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca and the Germans have outlawed miracles.\n\nThe story takes place during World War II. Casablanca, an unoccupied French colony, has become a purgatory for European refugees looking to escape to America. We meet Rick, an American expatriate played by Humphrey Bogart. He runs the most popular cafe in town. As Louis, the venal Prefect of Police played by Claude Rains says:\n\n>Everybody comes to Rick's.\n\nAt Rick's they're entertained by Sam, a piano playing singer played by Dooley Wilson. Aside from Sam and the cafe, Rick maintains a cool detachment from everything and everyone. That changes once long-lost flame Ilsa (played by Ingrid Bergman) walks in on the arm of Victor Lazlo, a resistance leader wanted by the Germans.\n\nSeeing Ilsa shakes Rick from his isolationist stance, and soon he's abetting the local resistance. The Germans retaliate by insisting Louis shut down the cafe. Amid the chaos of the police chasing everyone out, Rick demands an explanation:\n\n>LOUIS  \nI'm shocked, SHOCKED, to find gambling going on here!\n\n>(A croupier approaches with a large wad of cash)\n\n>CROUPIER  \nYour winnings sir.\n\n>LOUIS  \nOh, thank you, very much!\n\nThat's not just funny, it's Billy Wilder funny.\n\nBut the film pivots with ease. Grounded in relatable emotions, the melodrama packs a punch. Consider how Rick spits venom at Ilsa:\n\n>Well, I guess neither one of our stories is very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Lazlo, or were there others in between or… aren't you the kind that tells?\n\nNo weepy speeches, just relatable emotion setup by an earlier scene between a drunken Rick and Sam:\n\n>SAM  \nLet's get outta here.\n\n>RICK  \nNo Sam, I'm waiting for a lady.\n\n>SAM  \nPlease boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.\n\n>RICK (staring at the liquor in front of him)  \nShe's coming back. I know she's coming back.\n\n>SAM  \nWe'll take the car. We'll drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.\n\n>RICK (not looking at Sam)  \nShut up and go home, will ya?\n\n>SAM  \nNo sir, I'm staying right here.\n\nGreat lines abound but some of the film's best moments are visual. I didn't discover them until years later, when I finally sat down and watched the film. Nice touches like when the waiter checks his pockets after the pickpocket bumps him. Or the beat-perfect editing between Rick and Louis during the finale. \n\nAnd let's talk about that ending. It's not a happy one. Rick sends the love of his life away and goes off to a likely death. Noble? Absolutely. But in an era where studios were allergic to unhappy endings, it's amazing this one went over.\n\nFurther, it's impressive how the script doesn't have Ilsa waffle, even when she believes Rick has betrayed Victor. This casts her in an unflattering light, but gives the ending its resonance.\n\nI was a movie buff before _Casablanca_. It's what got me the video store job. But _Casablanca_ made me a Bogart fan, which led me to _The Big Sleep (1946)_ and _The Maltese Falcon (1941)_, which led me to _The Thin Man (1934)_, along with the films of John Huston and Howard Hawks, which led me to the films of William Powell and John Wayne, which led me to _Rio Bravo (1959)_, and well… you get the idea. _Casablanca_ changed my life.\n\nAnd I'm not alone. Roger Ebert considered _Casablanca_ his favorite movie.

","rawMarkdownBody":"\nBuried under the bad, there's just enough good to make _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ a frustrating experience. \n\nThe film opens during the final moments of _Man of Steel (2013)_. We follow Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne rushing through the chaotic streets of Metropolis. \n\nOverhead, Superman battles Zod—a Kryptonian bent on wiping out humanity. The two aliens crash through buildings and unleash arcs of laser-like heat vision. \n\nAs Bruce approaches Wayne Enterprises' Metropolis office, Superman and Zod rip through the building like a bullet. The skyscraper topples, sending out a massive cloud of debris. \n\nPeople scream. \n\nEmergency responders freeze. \n\nBruce Wayne runs toward the destruction. \n\nAs the dust clears, Bruce snatches little girl from the path of some falling debris. He crouches down and looks in her wide eyes. “It's going to be okay,” he says. “We're going to find your mom. Where is she? Where's your mom?” \n\nThe girl points—her arm shaking—toward the smoldering rubble of the Wayne tower. Bruce pulls the girl close and glares up—eyes full of rage—at Superman and Zod still zooming through the air. \n\nWith that shot, any apprehension I had about Affleck evaporated. He's not wearing the suit, but he's Batman. \n\nConsider this sequence's accomplishments. \n\nIt summarizes and even provides the payoff for the excessive destruction sequences of the prior film. \n\nIt sells Affleck in the role of Batman. \n\nIt establishes motivation for the conflict between the titular characters. \n\nAll this with near-constant action and no exposition. It's an amazing sequence. \n\nBut it also commits the film's most egregious sin: it raises our expectations. \n\nFrom here, the film devolves into a mess of dead-end plot threads and superfluous characters. \n\nSome had potential. Holly Hunter plays a US Senator chairing a hearing discussing Superman's unchecked role in global affairs. We're given an iconic image of Superman hovering outside the Capitol building, before symbolically landing and walking inside. What followed should have been crackling, character-driven drama. Instead, the building blows up. \n\nThis explosion comes courtesy of Lex Luthor, played by Jessie Eisenberg as an eccentric young industrialist. He blows up the Capitol because—well, mostly because the script feels stitched together. Luthor manipulates Superman and Batman into fighting one another because—well, see above. Luthor also creates a giant monster because… well, you get the idea. \n\nOther characters and scenes exist solely to set up the next films in the franchise. We meet Wonder Woman. She's superfluous to the story, but proves a compelling character, largely because she's devoid of angst. We also get awkward teases for Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. \n\nIndeed, there's so much going on, I can't imagine someone following it all without having read the comics. \n\nHow else to recognize the small, but important bits of characterization? Like how Joker's murdering Robin lead to this film's more brutal Batman. Or bigger bits, like uber-villain Darkseid's Omega sigil in Bruce's apocalyptic vision and how Luthor's ramblings in the finale reference Darkseid's mother box technology. Reading between the lines, Luthor was little more than Renfield to Darkseid's Dracula. \n\nBut relying on the viewer's prior exposure to the characters invites preconceived notions of who these characters should be. And I can't imagine anyone familiar with the Superman mythos getting behind this version of Luthor. \n\nAnd we haven't even covered the inanity of a script that sees Batman murder criminals and cause the same wanton destruction that so enraged him during the film's opening sequence. Consider Batman, in his plane, leading a monster back to the city so he can retrieve a weapon that might kill it. Why not fly back, grab the weapon, then battle the monster in relative isolation? Because the movie isn't interested in making sense. It's too busy trying to build a franchise.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/68ce4615fad7d96562abfe8e397713af/9b7de/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-2016.jpg","srcSet":"/static/68ce4615fad7d96562abfe8e397713af/eb003/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-2016.jpg 200w,\n/static/68ce4615fad7d96562abfe8e397713af/11f33/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-2016.jpg 400w,\n/static/68ce4615fad7d96562abfe8e397713af/9b7de/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-2016.jpg 800w,\n/static/68ce4615fad7d96562abfe8e397713af/29626/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-2016.jpg 1200w,\n/static/68ce4615fad7d96562abfe8e397713af/0a886/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-2016.jpg 1600w,\n/static/68ce4615fad7d96562abfe8e397713af/032f3/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-2016.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"22 May 2017","grade":"C","slug":"play-motel-1979","sequence":"92","movie":{"title":"Play Motel","runtimeMinutes":90,"originalTitle":"Play Motel","year":1979,"directors":[{"fullName":"Mario Gariazzo"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"I expected a sleazy giallo and I got a sleazy giallo.

That surprised me.\n\nAs of this writing, the film's IMDb page has no trivia. No proof the American distributor already owned the song, spliced it into the soundtrack, and changed the film's title. Nope, none at all. So, clearly, director Mario Gariazzo commissioned the theme, believing it a perfect tonal fit. If that's true, it might merit an extra star.\n\nThe film's plot concerns a blackmail scam photographing wealthy marks in compromising positions in the titular establishment. Said positions feature lots of nudity and kinky behavior.\n\nSoon, a black-gloved killer starts picking off victims peripheral to the scam. After the killer stashes a body in a parked car's trunk, the car's owners, a young couple, get involved.\n\nAt the local police's urging, the couple turns amateur sleuths, a questionable decision that sees the wife pose nude for a sleazy photographer while her husband waits in the car. When she's inevitably captured and beaten, he's laughably unconcerned.\n\nThis all plays out as an over-the-top cross between Scooby-Doo and softcore porn. The end reveal is laugh-out-loud implausible, and the blackmail scenes are as explicit as the censors would allow. It's pure exploitation in all it's ridiculous glory and I'll admit, it kept me entertained. If sleazy giallos are your thing, _Play Motel_ won't disappoint.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/86c2c2206b6a2b617fb8f953a005f4e8/9b7de/play-motel-1979.jpg","srcSet":"/static/86c2c2206b6a2b617fb8f953a005f4e8/eb003/play-motel-1979.jpg 200w,\n/static/86c2c2206b6a2b617fb8f953a005f4e8/11f33/play-motel-1979.jpg 400w,\n/static/86c2c2206b6a2b617fb8f953a005f4e8/9b7de/play-motel-1979.jpg 800w,\n/static/86c2c2206b6a2b617fb8f953a005f4e8/29626/play-motel-1979.jpg 1200w,\n/static/86c2c2206b6a2b617fb8f953a005f4e8/0a886/play-motel-1979.jpg 1600w,\n/static/86c2c2206b6a2b617fb8f953a005f4e8/032f3/play-motel-1979.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"15 May 2017","grade":"A+","slug":"heat-1995","sequence":"91","movie":{"title":"Heat","runtimeMinutes":170,"originalTitle":"Heat","year":1995,"directors":[{"fullName":"Michael Mann"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"I tilt forward in my seat.

The balls of my feet press into the floor. My hands clench tight and I realize I'm holding my breath. _Heat_ on the big screen is an experience.\n\nI've seen the film several times, yet the centerpiece shootout scene in the streets of downtown Los Angeles always elicits a visceral reaction.\n\nBoiled down, it's a cops and robbers story. Robert De Niro leads a crew of professional thieves taking down a series of Los Angeles scores. Al Pacino leads the cops in pursuit. They're archetypes in the Howard Hawks tradition—professions personified.\n\nIndeed, _Heat_ feels like a Hawks picture, right down to the underwritten female characters. But while Hawks romanticized the professional, _Heat_ shows us the cost of such a lifestyle. De Niro plans the heists with military precision, yet lives alone in a palatial seaside estate that could pass for vacant. Pacino hunts De Niro's crew with obsessive fervor, even as his third marriage crumbles around him. Both performances feel larger than life yet intensely human.\n\nBut back to the shootout. It makes the movie. The scene carries an immense gravitas because everything about it feels authentic. From the way the characters fire short bursts and reload, to their tactical movements, it all resonates.\n\nThat's not to say writer/director Michael Mann values authenticity over drama. His kinetic editing includes plenty of long and wide shots to establish movement and geography, immersing us in the scene. We don't witness the gunfight we _experience_ it.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/8f2b64c061e1829bfe238f518ea7df9c/9b7de/heat-1995.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8f2b64c061e1829bfe238f518ea7df9c/eb003/heat-1995.jpg 200w,\n/static/8f2b64c061e1829bfe238f518ea7df9c/11f33/heat-1995.jpg 400w,\n/static/8f2b64c061e1829bfe238f518ea7df9c/9b7de/heat-1995.jpg 800w,\n/static/8f2b64c061e1829bfe238f518ea7df9c/29626/heat-1995.jpg 1200w,\n/static/8f2b64c061e1829bfe238f518ea7df9c/0a886/heat-1995.jpg 1600w,\n/static/8f2b64c061e1829bfe238f518ea7df9c/032f3/heat-1995.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"08 May 2017","grade":"C+","slug":"free-fire-2016","sequence":"90","movie":{"title":"Free Fire","runtimeMinutes":91,"originalTitle":"Free Fire","year":2016,"directors":[{"fullName":"Ben Wheatley"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"You know that scene in crime movies, where a back-alley deal turns sour, resulting in a shootout? _Free Fire_ stretches that into an entire movie.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nYou know that scene in crime movies, where a back-alley deal turns sour, resulting in a shootout? _Free Fire_ stretches that into an entire movie.\n\nSet in 1978 Boston, the plot sees Cillian Murphy and Michael Smiley play IRA gang leaders buying guns from gang leaders played by Sharlto Copley and Armie Hammer. Brie Larson plays the intermediary. As the deal goes down, a grunt in one gang squabbles with a grunt the other gang, escalating into a full-fledged melee. Amid the flying bullets, the script weaves in some double-crosses. But honestly? The details escape me. _Free Fire_ isn’t concerned with plot, but style.\n\nAnd it’s got style to spare. The clothes, the hair, the set decoration—this movie does the impossible: it makes 1978 look cool. Do they give Academy Awards for that? They should.\n\nBut as much as I enjoyed the film’s look, the execution frustrated me. When the firefight breaks out, director Ben Wheatley offers no sense of geography. Folks shoot and scramble for cover but we have no sense of their placement in relation to one another. A few wide shots would have sufficed.

On her first night, a hazing ritual sees masked men invade the dorms and force the freshmen to march and crawl—half dressed—across the campus. I couldn’t believe how the students reacted. No one asserted themselves or fought back. Maybe it’s a cultural thing (it’s a French film) but the herd imagery felt too pointed.\n\nThe plot kicks in when another hazing ritual forces Justine—a lifelong vegetarian—to try meat. This first taste unlocks an insatiable craving for human flesh.\n\nOn the surface, _Raw_ is about Justine discovering and battling her cannibalistic urges. But writer/director Julia Ducournau positions cannibalism as a metaphor for escaping overbearing parents, discovering one’s sexuality, defending animal rights, and struggling to escape an older sibling’s shadow.\n\nJuggling so many metaphors leaves little time for subtlety. It’s frustrating. Several scenes made me uncomfortable but said discomfort felt manipulative and obnoxious. Other scenes fall apart upon reflection. Some scenes do both. The night following her first taste of meat, Justine awakens covered in huge itchy welts with swaths of her skin peeling off in dry sheets. She yawns and goes back to sleep.\n\nStill, _Raw_ has its strengths. The cinematography grabbed my attention from the opening shot, and the performances convince to the degree the script allows.\n\nBut I just couldn’t buy it. For a film desperate to frame its genre elements as a serious conceit, too many details strained credibility. Justine as a cannibal? Sure. But a campus full of kids not glued to their smartphones?

Just as he meets the girl of his dreams and finds the happiness that's eluded him all his life, Wade learns he's developed terminal cancer. A mysterious organization reaches out with the promise of a cure. Wade accepts, but the cure carries at a steep price. Presumed dead, Wade embarks on a mission of vengeance, complete with running color commentary.\n\n_Deadpool_ plays as a self-aware comic book film. The first time I watched it, I laughed so hard I missed most of the jokes. Besides the non-stop non-sequiturs, we get jokes about the plot, jokes about the other _X-Men_ films, and jokes about the limited budget. They're not belittling the genre, just mining it for laughs.\n\nAnd these laughs come wrapped in a solid origin story. The film invests time in Wade and his relationships, making him more than a clown.\n\nMost of the credit goes to Reynolds. His deadpan comedy proves the perfect match for the character's gallows humor. He doesn't just carry the film, he propels it along with his considerable charisma. This despite having essentially a voice-over role for most of his scenes.\n\nIt's said one can mark a genre's end when it devolves into comedy, as _Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)_ ended the Universal Monster era. But that needn't be the case. Rather than transplant genre characters into a comedic film, _Deadpool_ takes a genre film and adds liberal doses of comedy. It's a subtle but important distinction. _Deadpool_ may be hilarious, but it's a comic book movie first, and a comedy second.","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/9b7de/deadpool-2016.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/eb003/deadpool-2016.jpg 200w,\n/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/11f33/deadpool-2016.jpg 400w,\n/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/9b7de/deadpool-2016.jpg 800w,\n/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/29626/deadpool-2016.jpg 1200w,\n/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/0a886/deadpool-2016.jpg 1600w,\n/static/a4db9d2302469e5de20aaf4cb4125383/032f3/deadpool-2016.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"17 Apr 2017","grade":"D+","slug":"shock-1946","sequence":"87","movie":{"title":"Shock","runtimeMinutes":70,"originalTitle":"Shock","year":1946,"directors":[{"fullName":"Alfred L.

The plot alone will convince you it's worth watching. Price plays a psychiatrist who murders his wife. Unbeknownst to him, Anabel Shaw's character witnesses the murder from her hotel room. The sight renders her catatonic and she falls under the care of—you guessed it—Price's character. Better still: Shaw's character spies the murder only after waking from an anxiety-laden nightmare, calling into question her reliability as a narrator.\n\nIt could play as a cross between _Rebecca (1940)_ and _Suspicion (1941)_. Instead, it plays like _Double Indemnity (1944)_. There's no doubt Price's character is guilty. He's egged on by femme fatale Lynn Bari.\n\nI can hear you saying to yourself, “That sounds interesting.”\n\nI'm here to tell you, it isn't. Price doesn't register as charming or sinister. He has zero chemistry with Bari, who herself fails to register as seductive or cunning. This renders the entire film rather boring, which as I've written before, is a film's most unforgivable sin.\n\nBut let's face it: if you're a Vincent Price fan, you won't believe me. Price played this sort of role so well in so many later pictures, you can't fathom him falling flat. To those fans, I offer this condolence: if you make it through the film, you'll see the ending, which I found so unintentionally funny I laughed aloud.

Sure, seeing colonel John \"Hannibal\" Smith play a romantic lead will shock those of a certain age, but the jolt is short-lived. Peppard pulls off the role with aplomb.\n\nIt starts with his clothes. Okay—not really, but I love his wardrobe.\n\nPeppard plays Paul, a writer posing as a gigolo or vice versa. As the film opens, he's moving into a converted New York brownstone apartment. There he meets Holly Golightly, a quirky socialite played by Hepburn.\n\nHe falls for her. She for him. Complications ensue. What makes _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ special is not the plot, but the characters.\n\nPaul and Holly are both damaged people, skirting responsibility and commitment with a fear bordering on phobic. When Paul meets Holly he's drawn by her fragile nature. The diminutive Hepburn looks the part. Paul longs to swoop in and save Holly. Unlike her other suitors, Paul's in no position to save anyone, he's just as wounded.\n\nPatricia Neal plays the rich, married woman who pays Paul's rent and keeps him in nice clothes. She makes an impression by underplaying her role. As does Buddy Ebsen as a lovesick figure from Holly's shadowy past.\n\nIt's this willingness to embrace flawed characters—and not flawed in cute ways, but morally suspect ones—that makes _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ stand out.\n\nSure, we get plenty of soft focus close-ups, Mickey Rooney as a racist caricature meant as comic relief, and a finale set in a rainy, yet well-lit alley, but _Breakfast at Tiffany's_ transcends the tropes.\n\nMy biggest complaint lies with the ending. Holly isn't a real person, she's a ghost, drifting in and out of people's lives, leaving an indelible impression. That Paul could end up with her doesn't ring true. She's not the girl you marry, she's the girl you wonder about years later.\n\nStill, it's a great film and Hepburn deserves the kudos showered upon her performance. But it works because Peppard wins us over too.\n","backdrop":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7699115044247788,"src":"/static/14c29cbb7108b1cce94800e0c419a42f/9b7de/breakfast-at-tiffanys-1961.jpg","srcSet":"/static/14c29cbb7108b1cce94800e0c419a42f/eb003/breakfast-at-tiffanys-1961.jpg 200w,\n/static/14c29cbb7108b1cce94800e0c419a42f/11f33/breakfast-at-tiffanys-1961.jpg 400w,\n/static/14c29cbb7108b1cce94800e0c419a42f/9b7de/breakfast-at-tiffanys-1961.jpg 800w,\n/static/14c29cbb7108b1cce94800e0c419a42f/29626/breakfast-at-tiffanys-1961.jpg 1200w,\n/static/14c29cbb7108b1cce94800e0c419a42f/0a886/breakfast-at-tiffanys-1961.jpg 1600w,\n/static/14c29cbb7108b1cce94800e0c419a42f/032f3/breakfast-at-tiffanys-1961.jpg 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},{"date":"03 Apr 2017","grade":"B+","slug":"logan-2017","sequence":"85","movie":{"title":"Logan","runtimeMinutes":137,"originalTitle":"Logan","year":2017,"directors":[{"fullName":"James Mangold"}]},"markdown":{"firstParagraph":"It's taken 17 years, but _Logan_ gives us the Wolverine we've always wanted.","rawMarkdownBody":"\nIt's taken 17 years, but _Logan_ gives us the Wolverine we've always wanted.\n\nHugh Jackman reprises the titular role for what he claims is the final time. Given the film's box office success, I consider his retirement suspect, but I digress.\n\nThe film opens with Logan jarred from a drunken stupor in the back seat of a car. He stumbles out to discover a gang of young thieves attempting to strip the car. He pleas for them to stop and the thieves shoot him without a moment's hesitation. He drops to the ground, apparently dead.\n\nA beat passes and Logan struggles to his feet. The thieves turn, surprised. Once again, Logan appeals to reason. Again, the thieves shoot him. Logan's temper snaps, he lets loose a slew of obscenities and winces in anger as he unsheathes his claws. The thieves' eyes go wide with terror as Logan snarls and charges forward, dismembering the punks in a bloody burst of violence.\n\nThis film earns its R-rating but doesn't wallow in it. The violence feels gritty but not gratuitous. This is Wolverine uncensored, ripped from the comics and thrust into the real world.\n\nWell, almost. The time, we learn, is the near-future. The place is the southern US. Logan earns a low-profile living driving a limousine. He spends his meager earnings bribing hospital staff for the medication he administers to Charles Xavier, played once again by Patrick Stewart.\n\nForced into hiding, Logan and Xavier are all that remain of the X-Men. Xavier's succumbing to dementia, rendering his mind a potential weapon of mass destruction. Logan's mutant healing ability is fading and the adamantium lacing his bones is slowly poisoning him. Facing mortality and struggling to make ends meet, they are comic book heroes made human.\n\nWell, almost. The plot kicks in when Logan discovers he has a daughter who's being hunted by a military-industrial conglomerate. As much as the film yearns to transcend the comic book genre, we get a cybernetic head bad guy, an evil Wolverine clone, and some magic healing juice that exists to facilitate the third act. These aren't deal-breakers, but they weaken the film's impact. With so much nonsense it's hard to take the serious parts, well, seriously.\n\nStill, I enjoyed _Logan_, if for nothing more than Jackman and Stewart's performances. They make their characters feel familiar yet fresh and appear to relish the unidealized roles. That said, as the film unwound, I kept hoping Ian McKellen would turn up as Magneto. His scenes with Stewart were among the highlights of _X-Men (2000)_, and he deserves an encore.

The vampires bicker over household chores, dress for a night out, and prepare dinner for their would-be victims. In these moments, the film shines. Watching them struggle to dress up without mirrors had me roaring.\n\nAs a genre fan, I liked how the film satirized multiple cinematic vampire incarnations. Everything from _Nosferatu (1922)_ through _Twilight (2008)_. The interplay between these incarnations offers some of the film's best laughs. There's also a group of werewolves, lead by Rhys Darby in a scene-stealing performance.\n\nI also enjoyed the film's willingness to embrace the gore. One horrific yet hilarious scene involves a vampire trying and failing to devour a victim without spraying blood all over an antique couch.\n\nBut about the length. Even at just 86 minutes, the film drags. The forced plot provides little emotional or comedic payoff and feels like dead weight. If reality TV can do without plot, why can't the film that skewers it?
