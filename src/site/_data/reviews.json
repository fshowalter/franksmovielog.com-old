Enigmatic loner Mister befriends orphaned teen Martin. They head out in Mister's old Cadillac, searching for the fabled sanctuary of New Eden. Along the way, they run up against a fundamentalist militia using vamps as weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIt plays more like a western than horror. After a grisly opening sequence where a vamp drains an infant, the film keeps its baddies off-screen as much as possible. Instead, it relies on scenery to build atmosphere. Deserted strip malls. Desolate two-lane blacktops. Overgrown buildings. Rusted scrapheaps. An urban wilderness.\n\nThe production values and supporting performances are better than the film's all but straight-to-video release would suggest. And the script features moments of genuine inspiration. When Martin hears his family is \u201calready dead,\u201d he accepts it with wisdom seldom seen in horror films.  And don't forget the part where the bad guys drop vampires from helicopters.\n\nBut _Stake Land_ isn't without its problems. The voice-over narration feels unnecessary. And I couldn't buy co-writer Nick Damici as Mister. His eyes betray the grizzled facade. Warren Oates would have been perfect, were he forty years younger and not dead.\n\nBut hey, did I mention the bad guys drop vampires from helicopters?", "slug": "stake-land-2010"}, {"file_path": "reviews/the-bloody-judge-1970.md", "sequence": 2, "imdb_id": "tt0064727", "title": "The Bloody Judge", "year": 1970, "date": "2014-08-03", "grade": "D", "review_content": "\nThe extras on _The Bloody Judge_ DVD are more interesting than the feature film.\n\nThe story takes place in England during the final days of King James II. Christopher Lee plays George Jeffreys, an infamous judge who meted out death sentences to suppress the burgeoning rebellion. These sham trials became known as the Bloody Assizes.\n\nIn the aforementioned DVD extras, Lee describes Jeffreys as a Jekyll-and-Hyde figure: a brilliant legal mind but also a merciless executioner. Had the film focused on this dichotomy, it might have worked.\n\nInstead, the film revolves around a fictitious love triangle. Jeffreys obsesses over Mary, a young peasant girl. Mary's lover, Harry, is part of the rebellion. Jeffreys longs to arrest Harry, but Harry's father is a political ally of Jeffreys. Instead, Jeffreys arrests Mary. Harry frees her. Jeffreys captures them both. They escape. Then the revolution happens.\n\nThere's also a blind oracle who may be psychic, and a man dressed like Boris Karloff in _The Tower of London (1939)_, torturing a semi-nude woman covered in Technicolor blood.\n\nThis mess of disparate plot-points has its roots in money. The production had multiple financiers, and each wanted a different film. One wanted a horror movie. Another wanted a historical drama. Yet another wanted an exploitation picture. The filmmakers tried to please everyone. At least no one wanted a comedy.\n\nThe resulting compromise boils down to a string of overlong, exposition-leaden scenes interrupted by occasional bits of exploitation. Things pick up when the revolution gets underway, but not enough to recapture our interest. I can forgive stiff dialog, convoluted plotting, gratuitous nudity and violence. I can't forgive boring.\n\nCompounding matters, Lee and director Jes\u00fas Franco disagreed on how to portray Jeffreys. Lee wanted historical accuracy. Franco wanted something more \"dynamic.\" I don't know what Franco meant by \"dynamic\" and, judging by his performance, Lee didn't either.\n\nConsider how Lee shifts his weight and looks uncomfortable whenever he sits down. In the DVD extras, Lee explains that Jeffreys suffered from kidney stones. Lee was a fine actor, but without script help, kidney stones is an impossible charade.\n\nThe financing amalgam also explains the myriad of alternate titles. In the United States it was _Night of the Blood Monster_. In England it was _Witch Killer of Broadmoor_, even though there's no Broadmoor in the film. Granted, there's no Blood Monster either, but why Broadmoor?

Two linebacker-sized men get out and unload a swath of equipment, including a large coil of thick rope. The car pulls away and speeds across Tower Bridge, stopping on the opposite side. The driver and passenger exit the car, hurry across the road, and hide. Looking down, one of them checks his wristwatch.\n\nCut to another wristwatch. Pull back to reveal the burly men who exited the car prior. They setup a roadblock to divert traffic, then rush onto the bridge to secure the heavy rope for the group\u2019s escape.\n\nCut to the armored car approaching. The driver, an inside man, stops just before the bridge. The hidden men, now masked, spring into action. Guns drawn, they force their way inside the armored car and maneuver it across the bridge.\n\nCut to the Tower Bridge operator. Klaus Kinski sneaks up behind him, knocks him out, drags him back into the control booth, and raises the Tower Bridge.\n\nCut back to the armored car. With the roadblock diverting traffic on one end, and the raised bridge blocking traffic on the other, the thieves loot the armored car. Using the heavy rope, they zip the cash bags down to a boat waiting below.\n\nIt\u2019s a terrific opening. Almost no dialog. Just crackerjack editing and great location photography. Granted, with no sign of a circus or top-billed Christopher Lee, one can imagine theater-goers in 1966 feeling confused. Did the projectionist queue the wrong movie? As if to assure them, the opening titles appear, backed by an oddly catchy theme.\n\nUnfortunately, the entire heist was a McGuffin. All the crooks except Kinski are killed. This was a British-German co-production and Kinski was big in Germany.\n\nThe setting shifts to the winter home of the Barberini circus. The pacing slows. Things get talky. Over twenty minutes in, Christopher Lee finally shows up. He plays Gregor, an enigmatic lion tamer who wears a black balaclava to mask his disfigurement. Leo Genn plays a police inspector poking around after the stolen money.\n\nFrom here, the movie devolves into an unremarkable whodunit. An unseen, knife-throwing assailant picks off potential suspects. There are lots of red herrings and at least one plot twist you\u2019ll see coming.\n\nIt\u2019s not a bad movie, but _Circus of Fear_ squanders the talent involved. Director John Moxey can build atmosphere (as the opening heist shows) but the convoluted plot gives him few opportunities. Christopher Lee spends much of his limited screen time wearing a ridiculous hood. And Klaus Kinski's post-heist role sees him reduced to lurking about in the shadows.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating.

We\u2019re shown how radio demagogues cultivate resentment and fear, driving Legion membership. New members buy mandatory uniforms and revolvers, fattening the wallets of a small group of profiteers who, in turn, fund the demagogues.

It's a simple story, but I loved its straightforward, character-driven, approach. We meet Dwight as he's easing into a warm bath inside a cozy single family home.

The British suspect the famed German spy Strendler has infiltrated their organization, but no one can identify him. Desperate to weed out Strendler, the British plan to recall their best agent from undercover duty.\n\nThis plan also leaks to the Germans. They kill the British agent and shoot down his extraction plane.\n\nThe pilot, Frank Bennett, survives. We see him recovering in a hospital. A nurse, Helene von Lorbeer, played by Margaret Lindsay, tends to him. There\u2019s an attraction between the two, but von Lorbeer says she has to leave.\n\nVon Lorbeer turns out to be a German spy. She\u2019s recalled to headquarters, given a commendation and a new assignment. Posing as a refugee, she\u2019s to infiltrate the house of British cabinet minister Arthur Bennett. Arthur is, of course, Frank\u2019s father.\n\nVon Lorbeer quickly ingratiates herself with the Bennett family. Her German contact is the family butler Valdar, played by Boris Karloff. Unbeknownst to von Lorbeer, Valdar is a double-agent, reporting to the head of British Intelligence.\n\nSome sloppy code-passing by von Lorbeer arouses the suspicions of British Intelligence. They set a trap involving a would-be German agent, but Von Lorbeer sees through it, maintaining her cover.\n\nThe return of Frank Bennett prompts von Lorbeer to reveal that she\u2019s actually a British agent. Valdar overhears this and forces von Lorbeer into the cellar at gunpoint. Von Lorbeer claims she invented the British agent story to allay Frank\u2019s suspicions. Valdar doesn\u2019t believe her, but relents after seeing her German commendation. He admits that he is Strendler. Further, the British cabinet are meeting upstairs and he\u2019s planted a bomb to level the house under the guise of a Zeppelin bombing. He\u2019s even stolen plans for the next British offensive.\n\nBut the authorities had suspected Valdar and kept him under surveillance. They rush into the cellar and disarm the bomb but Valdar flees with the plans. He\u2019s shot during his escape but makes it to a German safe house. Just as German agents prepare to transmit the British plans, a Zeppelin bomb levels the building.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of plot. The labyrinthine twists of agents, double agents, and triple agents, leave little room for characterization. But maybe that\u2019s by design. Characterization requires a degree of plausibility, and _British Intelligence_ has none.\n\nTake Valdar\u2019s big reveal that he is Strendler. If Valdar was a British agent, he would have told the British about von Lorbeer, making the ruse involving the fake German agent unnecessary. But, if Valdar didn\u2019t tell the British about von Lorbeer, how did they know her handler\u2019s code phrases? Surely, they wouldn\u2019t be reused between agents. And just how did Valdar acquire so much guarded information? His espionage consists of little-more than standing outside thin doors or open windows. As a butler, he wouldn\u2019t be privy to anything discussed at a secure location.\n\nWorse still, even at only an hour and six minutes, _British Intelligence_ is too long. The lengthy opening sequence only serves to introduce Frank Bennett, who disappears for much of the film, only to surface a few minutes before the end. Why not start with von Lorbeer undercover? She\u2019d be a sympathetic character until her reveal as a German spy, which would have been a good one.\n\n_British Intelligence_ may be overlong and beset with plot holes, but at least it\u2019s got Karloff.

The police cart his body off to the morgue.\n\nBut of course, he\u2019s not dead.\n\nJason wakes up, dispatches some improbably young hospital staff members, then heads back to Crystal Lake to work through a house of oversexed teens.\n\nThis script operates on a simple, but proven, formula: titillate then shock[^2]. Show some nudity, then have Jason dispatch someone in a gruesome, over-the-top, fashion. To that end, it delivers.\n\nBut it also goes a step further by fleshing out its cast of teen victims. They spend much of the film unaware of Jason or any suspicious goings-on. They\u2019re in their own movie, complete with their own sub-plots. Granted, those sub-plots amount to little more than a bad teen sex comedy, but they hold our interest when Jason\u2019s off-screen[^3].\n\nAnd when Jason\u2019s on-screen, he\u2019s a juggernaut. An unstoppable, inhuman force of evil. A demon with a machete[^4]. Consider how Jason never runs. Running implies chasing. Chasing suggest the possibility of escape. In this film, Jason isn\u2019t an assailant, he\u2019s an inevitability[^5].\n\n_Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter_ is pure, well-executed, exploitation. An amalgam of gratuitous nudity and creative violence. A visceral thrill-ride. It\u2019s not a great movie, but it\u2019s everything my younger self could have hoped for.\n\n[^1]: Films two, three, and four happen back-to-back over four days. This entry starts on Sunday the 15th, and ends on Tuesday the 17th. Yet one character is out to avenge his dead sister, who Jason killed in the second film. Said character has been compiling newspaper clippings on Jason since her death. Except, by the film\u2019s timeline, his sister died less than 48 hours ago. Was he scrapbooking during the funeral?\n\n[^2]: Slasher films aren\u2019t alone in this. One of the best scares in _Alien (1979)_ comes after the camera lingers on some pin-ups of nude women.\n\n[^3]: It also helps that Crispin Glover\u2019s performance foreshadows his turn in _Back to the Future (1985)_. His dancing scene almost makes the movie.\n\n[^4]: _Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)_ cements this personification by turning him into a kind of Frankenstein\u2019s monster.\n\n[^5]: As a supernatural inevitability, in addition to asphyxiation, Jason would seem immune to the laws of physics.

I knew the instant it happened. I may have uttered a small groan. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.\n\nIt\u2019s three or four generations into the future. Earth is drying up. Giant dust storms ravage the planet. Blight has eradicated all the world\u2019s crops, save corn.\n\nMatthew McConaughey plays Cooper, a former test pilot/engineer who, like just about everyone else, must farm to survive. He hates it, but does it to support his two young children.\n\nA series of gravitational anomalies lead him to the remnants of NASA. NASA has a plan to save humanity. They\u2019ve discovered a wormhole near Saturn leading to potentially hospitable worlds. They\u2019ve got a ship and crew ready. They just need a pilot.\n\nCooper agrees, even though the journey\u2019s length means he\u2019ll miss years of his children\u2019s lives. If he makes it back at all.\n\nThe flight goes smoothly and the crew pass through the wormhole in a sequence that begs favorable comparisons with _2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)_. On the other side they assess their situation. They count three potential worlds, but the closest and most promising orbits the outskirts of a black hole. This creates a warping effect with time. An hour spent on the planet equates to seven years back on Earth.\n\nThey agree to be quick. Cooper pilots a shuttle craft to the planet\u2019s surface. Of course, there are complications. They return just over three hours later, and learn twenty-three years have passed on Earth. Cooper checks his video mail. He sees his son graduate high school, meet a girl, and get married. He sees the birth and death of his grandson. Finally, he sees his son, now a man older than himself, say goodbye, resigned that Cooper is never coming back. Cooper has missed it all. It flattens him and us. Never has a movie conveyed the isolation of space travel like this.\n\nThen Cooper gets a message from his daughter. They had a rough goodbye. She felt Cooper was abandoning her. Now, she\u2019s a full grown woman, the same age as him. But she hasn\u2019t forgiven his leaving.\n\nAnd this brings us to the point I mentioned earlier. The point where _Interstellar_ loses its way. The film cuts to Cooper\u2019s daughter as she finishes her message. Now we\u2019re back on Earth. No longer alone. Now, we have parallel stories, Cooper in space and Cooper\u2019s family on earth. What started as a meditation on mankind transcending Earth devolves into a predictable melodrama. The special effects are fantastic, and the set pieces are tense and well-executed, but the film lacks anything new to say.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think _Interstellar_\u2019s reach exceeded its grasp. That it tried and failed. I don\u2019t think it tried at all. Rather than explore new themes it settled for familiar dramatic scenarios. Granted, it executes those tropes with masterful precision, but it\u2019s still a letdown. _Interstellar_ doesn\u2019t transcend the science fiction genre, it abandons it.", "slug": "interstellar-2014"}, {"file_path": "reviews/horror-of-dracula-1958.md", "sequence": 14, "imdb_id": "tt0051554", "title": "Horror of Dracula", "year": 1958, "date": "2014-12-29", "grade": "A", "review_content": "\nHoward Hawks once said that a good movie consisted of \u201cthree great scenes and no bad ones.\u201d Hammer\u2019s first entry in its _Dracula_ franchise gives us exactly that.\n\nThe first great scene comes early. Jonathan Harker has arrived at Castle Dracula posing as a librarian. While prowling the castle\u2019s corridors at night, he finds a young woman. She sports full lips, brilliant blue eyes and ample cleavage. She is terrified. She claims she\u2019s being held prisoner and begs Harker to help her escape. Harker feigns ignorance. She persists. His resolve weakens. He agrees to help her. Grateful, she bursts into tears and buries her head in his shoulder. The music shifts. Her eyes fix on Harker\u2019s neck. Her head tilts back as her eyes close. Her glistening lips draw back to reveal fangs. She bites Harker.\n\nJust as she does, Dracula (Christopher Lee) explodes into the room with a piercing shriek. Lee is feral and demonic. The camera zooms in. Lee\u2019s bloodshot eyes pin us to our seats. His gore-smeared mouth twists into a snarl revealing blood-covered fangs. The shot lasts all of a few seconds, but it still packs a punch. This is Dracula in all his visceral glory.\n\nThe second great scene happens at about the three-quarters mark. It\u2019s night and Arthur Holmwood (Michael Gough) has gone to the crypt of his recently deceased sister Lucy to assure himself that she is not a vampire. To Arthur\u2019s horror, he finds Lucy seemingly alive, returning to her tomb, leading a young girl. Lucy sees him. Her eyes light up with more than just brotherly love. \u201cCome, let me kiss you,\u201d she says to Arthur. She advances, baring her fangs. Arthur stands helpless, transfixed by her gaze.\n\nBefore she can consummate the act, Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) bursts onto the scene, thrusting a crucifix into Lucy\u2019s face. She backs away in agony. Van Helsing, jaw set, eyes full of cold detachment, advances. Lucy\u2019s cornered. Van Helsing presses the crucifix to her forehead. The flesh smolders and burns, leaving the imprint of the cross. Van Helsing stares down, unmoved. Lucy shrieks and flees into her tomb.\n\nIt\u2019s a crackerjack scene that works just as well today as it did half a century ago. The practical effects still look great and Cushing\u2019s performance in the scene is perfect.\n\nThe third great scene is the finale. Arthur and Van Helsing have chased Dracula back to his castle. Dawn is fast approaching. Van Helsing catches the Count before he can disappear down a secret passage. The two grapple. Dracula looks to have the upper hand. In a flash of inspiration, Van Helsing vaults atop a long table, runs the length, and launches himself toward the wall. He hits the wall high and pulls down the tapestry curtains, letting in the morning sun. Dracula tries to flee, but Van Helsing fashions a make-shift crucifix out of candle holders to pin him in place.\n\nThese swashbuckling acrobatics cement Van Helsing as the heroic foil to the villainous Dracula. Cushing\u2019s Van Helsing isn\u2019t just a wise man with a strong will, he\u2019s a man of action. The iconic monster hunter out to rid the world of supernatural evil.\n\nI vacillate between this film and _Dracula (1931)_ for my favorite interpretation of the Count. I prefer Lee\u2019s grittier performance, but dislike the overt physicality. His Dracula runs, grapples, and digs holes[^1]. It makes for more action on screen, but also lends the character a vulnerability that softens his edge. Also, Lee doesn\u2019t have any dialog apart from his introductory scene, which is a shame. A battle of wills between Cushing and Lee would have been dynamite[^2]. Imagine Lee, with his ominous baritone, delivering the classic line, \u201cFor one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you\u2019re a wise man, Van Helsing.\u201d\n\nBut these are minor quibbles. Buoyed by iconic performances from Cushing and Lee, _Horror of Dracula_ is a great film. It rolls along at a terrific pace. By paring down the supporting cast and playing up the sex and gore, it makes the familiar plot feel fresh and new. It turns a gothic horror story into a thrilling adventure. Howard Hawks\u2019 definition of a good movie may be a bit simplistic, but _Horror of Dracula_ is proof that simple can work.\n\n[^1]: The hole-digging scene always throws me. Why wouldn\u2019t he put her in the crypt? And how does he happen to have a shovel handy?\n\n[^2]: Lee and Cushing wouldn\u2019t meet again as Dracula and Van Helsing until the disappointing _Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972)_. Cushing starred in the immediate sequel _The Brides of Dracula (1960)_ which lacked Lee. Lee returned in the third installment _Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966)_ which lacked Cushing.", "slug": "horror-of-dracula-1958"}, {"file_path": "reviews/friday-the-13th-a-new-beginning-1985.md", "sequence": 15, "imdb_id": "tt0089173", "title": "Friday the 13th: A New Beginning", "year": 1985, "date": "2014-12-31", "grade": "D", "review_content": "\nAfter _Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)_ delivered the series\u2019s highest grosses, Paramount made an odd decision.

He\u2019s seventeen now, having spent the previous six years in a state mental institution. This rare bit of plausibility sets the film in 1990, give or take a year.\n\nDespite being the nominal lead, Tommy's superficial to the plot and says under two-dozen words throughout the film. His scenes consist of him either looking confused or erupting in sudden violent outbursts.\n\nThe setting is, of course, a remote camp. This time, a halfway house for troubled teens meant to ease their re-entry into society.\n\nThe plot kicks into gear after one teen murders another with an axe then disappears into the surrounding woods. Following that, an unseen assailant begins murdering teens, staff, and pretty-much everyone else.\n\nHarkening back to the original _Friday the 13th (1980)_, this entry withholds the killer\u2019s identity until the finale. We\u2019re offered several red-herrings, making this film more mystery-thriller than monster movie.\n\nBut the execution is sloppy. The script introduces characters then kills them in the same scene. Several performances veer well into camp. One character even dies trapped in a graffiti-covered outhouse after eating some spicy enchiladas.\n\nWorse still, the killer\u2019s eventual reveal elicits groans instead of gasps. The script offers an explanation via some awkward exposition, but it\u2019s unsatisfying.\n\nBut time has been kind. Knowing the franchise rights itself, fans can laugh at the nonsense plot, Tommy\u2019s non-dialog, and the hammy performances. I cannot recommend _Friday the 13th: A New Beginning_, yet I can't wholly condemn it either.

It opens with Tommy Jarvis determined to rid himself of the specter of Jason. En route to Crystal Lake, he plans to dig up Jason\u2019s corpse and incinerate it. He\u2019s even brought a buddy along for help[^1].\n\nTommy and his friend dig up the corpse all right, but a lightening strike reanimates the maggot-filled carcass. Undead Jason makes short work of Tommy\u2019s pal but Tommy escapes to warn the local sheriff. Of course, the sheriff doesn\u2019t believe Tommy and runs him out of town.\n\nMeanwhile, Jason resumes his murderous ways. He offs some corporate paintballers and a few teen camp counselors before Tommy gets back to town. Thinking Tommy committed the murders, the sheriff puts Tommy behind bars.\n\nNot to worry though, the sheriff\u2019s plucky teen daughter soon frees Tommy from his cell. Then, using a plan Tommy gleaned from reading a book on the occult, the two head to Camp Crystal Lake to confront Jason.\n\nThis entry cements Jason\u2019s transition from deranged madman to supernatural monster. Jason now has super human strength. Bullets can\u2019t kill him. Early on, Tommy looks to incinerate Jason, but the skies open and the resulting rain prevents Tommy from striking a match. It\u2019s a nice nod that casts Jason as something of a force of nature.\n\nThis installment also sports a nice streak of self-referential black comedy. As Jason stalks a group of children, one boy asks another in a deadpan tone: \u201cSo, what did you want to be when you grew up?\u201d\n\nIndeed, when Jason\u2019s on-screen this entry\u2019s a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the plot revolves around Tommy.\n\nA better script would have killed him off during the opening sequence. Instead, we suffer through a tired \u201cboy who cried wolf\u201d plot that never pays off, while cringing at the stilted melodrama with the sheriff\u2019s daughter. A stronger performer could have risen above the material. But Thom Mathews\u2019 wooden performance as Tommy kept reminding me of Michael Dudikoff in _American Ninja (1985)_. Minus the ninja bad-assery.\n\nThe focus on Tommy handicaps the supporting cast. Most of Jason\u2019s victims are forgettable. The female camp counselors, in particular, feel like interchangeable fodder.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an awful movie, but the forced melodrama and bland supporting cast drag things down. Whenever Jason\u2019s off-screen, _Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI_ is a snooze.\n\n[^1]: Ron Palillo, TV\u2019s Horshak!", "slug": "friday-the-13th-part-vi-jason-lives-1986"}, {"file_path": "reviews/friday-the-13th-part-vii-the-new-blood-1988.md", "sequence": 17, "imdb_id": "tt0095179", "title": "Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood", "year": 1988, "date": "2015-01-05", "grade": "F", "review_content": "\nThere\u2019s a lesson here.\n\nI came to _Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood_ with an open mind. Sure, I\u2019d heard rumblings it was bad, but the masses can be wrong.\n\nThe story opens with seven-year-old Tina standing outside a house on Crystal Lake. Inside, we hear her parents fighting. Mom\u2019s yelling at Dad, saying he promised he wouldn\u2019t drink so much. Dad\u2019s smacking Mom and telling her to shut up. It aims for drama but plays as caricature.\n\nTina runs down to the lake, walks down a short pier, and gets into a small fishing boat. She motors out to the middle of the lake.\n\nDad comes running out of the house[^1]. He yells for her to come back. Mom comes out and joins in the yelling. Dad advances down the pier.\n\nTina gives Dad the stink-eye of death and the pier starts shaking. Not a rumble, but a full-on cartoonish wobble. With the pylons jutting several feet into the air, it resembles a carnival ride gone haywire.\n\nThe pier crumbles into the lake, taking Dad with it.\n\nWe flash-forward to a seventeen-year-old[^2] Tina returning to Crystal Lake along with her mother. Her smarmy psychiatrist, Dr. Crews, insists Tina confront her father\u2019s death by revisiting the scene.\n\nTina and her mother arrive at the lake house. They find Dr. Crews waiting.\n\nNext door is an obligatory house full of teens.\n\nA few needless scenes later, Tina\u2019s telekinesis reanimates Jason[^3], who sets to work massacring the teens[^4].\nMeanwhile, Tina\u2019s mom uncovers Dr. Crews\u2019 true intentions.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of over-emoting and dues ex machina that culminates in Tina hurling flower pots at Jason with her mind.\n\nOkay, so the masses were right. Sitting through this was a chore. Like the song says: _Sometimes, bad is bad_. Lesson learned.\n\nIt should have been better. The script borrows its setup from the franchise\u2019s best entry, _Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)_. And Kane Hodder brings a hulking physicality to his performance as Jason.\n\nBut the film tacks on a mill stone subplot involving telekinetic Tina, her mother, and Dr. Crews that sinks the movie. More than once, I ached to fast-forward through these scenes. They aren\u2019t just bad. They\u2019re screaming baby on an airplane bad. Painful for everyone involved.\n\nI don\u2019t fault the performers; the script does them no favors. Consider Tina. She\u2019s an ineffectual protagonist who spends most of the film in histrionics. The worst kind of [final girl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_girl). When the other teens take an instant dislike to her, we\u2019re on their side. And speaking of those teens, they\u2019re just fodder. None of them register as individuals and they have no chemistry together.\n\nWorst of all, the film takes itself far too seriously. The black humor of _Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)_ is gone. So is the manic campiness of _Friday the 13th: A New Beginning (1985)_. Instead, we suffer through scenes alternating between idle boredom and overwrought melodrama.\n\nWhen Jason offs a character, it\u2019s a relief. Not because it breaks some nonexistent tension, but because we\u2019re one step closer to the film\u2019s end. In _Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood_, it\u2019s the audience, not Jason\u2019s quarry, that suffers.\n\n[^1]: My first thought upon seeing Dad: _[Stewart Smalley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart\\_Smalley)?_\n\n[^2]: Setting this entry in the then-future of 2001.

Despite the title, Jason didn\u2019t reach New York until the final twenty minutes. They should have called it _Jason Takes a Cruise_, the joke went, as most of the film took place aboard a boat.\n\nFor many fans, this perceived deception was reason enough to skip the film. They didn\u2019t miss much.\n\nThe movie opens with a teen couple fooling around on Crystal Lake. After an obligatory resurrection sequence, Jason makes short work of the teens and reclaims his trademark hockey mask[^1].\n\nFast-forward to the following morning. The local high school\u2019s graduating class sets sail for New York City aboard the Lazarus, an old ocean liner. As they depart, Jason sneaks aboard.\n\nWhile Jason disappears passengers, we\u2019re presented with a series of subplots involving the students. Our protagonist, Rennie, has visions of a child drowning. The captain\u2019s son, Sean, disappoints his father by fumbling the nautical equivalent of backing the car out of the garage. The prom queen tries to blackmail her biology teacher by seducing him on video.\n\nAfter thinning the supporting cast, Jason kills the captain. Sean discovers his father\u2019s body and alerts the others. In a refreshing twist, the kids arm themselves and prepare to go on the offensive.

Jason is, of course, right behind them.\n\nThe finale sees Rennie and Sean fleeing Jason through a sewer tunnel due to be flushed with toxic waste.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a good movie, but it\u2019s better than its predecessor, _Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988)_. Although the script saddles its protagonist with an overwrought subplot, it finds time to pepper the supporting cast with personality and even offers some chuckles. Granted, _Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)_ had a more memorable cast, and _Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI (1986)_ had wittier humor, but I can appreciate the effort.\n\nAnd yes, Jason spends more time prowling the Lazarus\u2019s corridors than Manhattan\u2019s streets, but so what? After seven films set at Camp Crystal Lake (or a reasonable facsimile), isn\u2019t any scenery change welcome?\n\nThe film\u2019s biggest disappointment isn\u2019t Jason\u2019s meandering journey to New York, it\u2019s that, once he\u2019s there, he gets tunnel vision. He walks through swaths of pedestrians and ignores them. Aside from some street punks, he\u2019s only interested in the Lazarus survivors.\n\nJason should be a one-man apocalypse, killing anyone within reach. Why else transplant him to the country\u2019s most populous city?\n\nTo that end, _Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan_ is more disappointing than awful. Aside from a change of scenery, it offers little we haven\u2019t seen done better before.\n\n[^1]: It even includes the axe-crack from _Friday the 13th Part III (1982)_.

Now he must do right by it. A deep-rooted psychological need drives him. Ivan's father abandoned him. Ivan refuses to do the same.\n\nThe film doles out this information in small bits as it unfolds. Each nugget raises the emotional stakes and increases the story\u2019s tension. In time, Ivan loses his job, his family and his home. He accepts these events with a calm detachment. These are the consequences of his actions. He compartmentalizes them. He holds to his logic. He must be there for his child. Early on, when Bethan asks if he loves her, Ivan replies \"How can I? I don't know you.\" His tone is not cruel. It is the voice of a man trying to convince her of a truth he needs to believe.\n\nWatching Ivan\u2019s world unravel is a compelling journey. Tom Hardy holds our attention from the very first scene. We want to learn more about his character. Through his eyes and inflection, Hardy conveys a character struggling to contain a sea of emotions. Setting the entire film in Ivan\u2019s car doesn\u2019t feel like a stunt, it feels natural. It adds to the claustrophobic sense of desperation that the film cultivates. By the end, we\u2019re hanging on every word.\n\nBut about that end. Just as abruptly as it began, the film is over. Ivan's world has changed and he heads off to what will be, for him, a new life. I didn't like this ending, but I'm not sure how I would change it. It felt anti-climatic. Not enough to ruin the film, but enough that it left me wanting. But perhaps that's the point. Just like Ivan, we\u2019re left with an odd sense of detachment.", "slug": "locke-2013"}, {"file_path": "reviews/rachel-and-the-stranger-1948.md", "sequence": 21, "imdb_id": "tt0040720", "title": "Rachel and the Stranger", "year": 1948, "date": "2015-01-15", "grade": "D", "review_content": "\nIn _Rachel and the Stranger_, William Holden plays David Harvey. David is a pioneer farmer living with his young son Davey in the Ohio wilderness. David's wife Susan died the previous year, sinking him into depression. It's only after finding Davey using a page from one of his school books as a sail for a toy boat, that David resolves to find a new wife. Not for love, but because he knew how important it was to Susan that Davey not grow up \"woodsy\".\n\nDavid travels to the nearby stockade and consults the Parson. The Parson suggests David buy the contract of a bond woman named Rachael. David likes the idea of a servant. A woman but not a wife.\n\nBut the Parson says, \"Decent church folk don't live together, man and woman, under the same roof without marriage.\" So David marries Rachael and takes her back to his farm.\n\nThough he is distant, David is not cruel to her. She sleeps in the bed, David sleeps in another room on the floor. Rachael is timid, but works to endear herself. David takes no notice.\n\nDavey, however, is downright cruel. When she tells him she was brought there to give him his schooling and sort of mother him, Davey spits back, \"The devil it was! You're a bond slave is all!\"\n\nThings change when Jim, a family friend played by Robert Mitchum, arrives. Jim's a hunter and tracker. He was a one time suitor of Susan, and both he and David were surprised she chose David over him. Jim, it seems, has decided to settle down, and takes an instant interest in Rachel.\n\nJim is attentive and charming. David gets jealous. Both men begin to vie for Rachel\u2019s attention, culminating in a fist-fight that leads to Rachel leaving them both. They go after her. There's an obligatory Indian attack, then it's over.\n\nThe three leads are solid. Young and Holden are convincing, and Mitchum is great as a laconic woodsman. But this is not a good movie. It takes us for simpletons incapable of picking up any subtlety.\n\nConsider when, after arriving in the cabin, Rachael is clearing the table. David and Davey are talking. Davey says he won't be getting any music lessons. We see Rachael pause. This should have been it. Instead, the film cuts to a drawn-out close-up of Rachael. We see her look off screen, open her mouth to say something, then close it and look down at Davey. Davey looks back, daring her to talk. She doesn't and walks away. It's a ten second scene that should have played out in an instant.\n\nThe script is clumsy too. Consider the scene where David and Davey are out working. They hear a turkey call. Davey whines abut wanting to go take a shot at the bird. David grabs Davey and dives to the ground. The turkey call is the signal of the Shawnee Indians, he says. Of course, it's just Jim, but when he steps out of the woods to greet David he tells them there's signs of Shawnee up to the north. We haven't heard a thing about Indians up to this point, but now the script mentions Shawnee four times in the span of two minutes. There isn't a mention of them again until they attack in the finale. This scene, like the Indian attack itself, feels tacked-on and forced.\n\nBut that's how most of this film works. Characters don't act organically, they act _conveniently_. Rachael is a reserved mouse until Jim and David get into a fight, then she announces she's leaving. Rachael has to leave so that David can win her back. Davey spends most of the film spitting venom at Rachael, but after she makes him a meal one night, he's happy to have her as his mother. Davey has to like her to allow David to fall in love.\n\nAnd speaking of Davey, he's an awful character. He's whiny and obstinate. We're given no reason to like him. Yes, he misses his mother. But the way he's presented, one suspects he was annoying long before Susan departed this earth.\n\nThere's a kernel of a good story here, and the three leads are more than capable of pulling it off. But the hackneyed melodramatic fable they're given to work with is frustrating at best, and annoying at worst. The adult themes of intimacy and emotional neglect belie a trite narrative that's presented in a condescending manner.

It's 1941. Robert Mitchum plays Mike Morrison, an American Correspondent who has just arrived in Greece. The Nazis are preparing to take the country and Mike plans to be on the next plane out. A member of the Greek resistance presents Mike with a list of Nazi collaborators. He urges Mike to take the list to British Intelligence. Mike declines, saying he doesn\u2019t want to get involved. Later, while out with a friend, Mike discovers the list in his jacket.  Mike attempts to unload the list to another Greek agent, but Gestapo agents are already on Mike's tail. They force him to flee through the darkened back streets of Athens. Mike escapes by hitching a ride on a British convoy.\n\nSo far, so good. But then the film goes off the rails.\n\nThe script jumps ahead. We learn that the Germans bombed the British Convoy and that Mike survived thanks to some fishermen who took him to a remote village. _Then_ the film jumps back and we see the convoy get bombed. Then we're back with Mike in a small Greek village.\n\nThese village scenes are dull and uninspiring. Stilted melodrama replaces suspense. A young, hotheaded female villager named Eleftheria nurses Mike back to health.\n\nOnce Mike is healthy, the film devolves into a clumsy wartime adventure. The villagers ask Mike to lead them on a raid of a Nazi supply depot. Because, who better to lead a guerrilla raid in the Greek countryside than an American journalist? While they're planning the raid, a British soldier shows up, says he'd like to help, learns all the details about the raid, then leaves. No one is concerned. Of course, the raid goes bad. The Nazi's slaughter all the men save Mike and another, who manage to get away. When they can't understand what happened, we almost laugh.\n\nAfter a bit, Mike and Eleftheria travel to a convent where Mike's given passage back to Athens. Once there, things get a little better, as the film shifts again, this time to a heist picture.\n\nLisa, a widowed British spy, is Mike's contact in Athens. The Gestapo gets wind of this and kidnaps Lisa's children. She's to turn over Mike if she wants to see her kids again. She sets Mike up, but changes her mind at the last minute. To rescue her children, she makes a deal with a local underworld figure named Chesney, played by Sebastian Cabot. Chesney double crosses the local Nazi agents while Lisa distracts the chief officer. It's a satisfactory ending, but one in which Mike is superfluous. By this point the list is all but forgotten, having been supplanted by Lisa's children as the motivating factor.\n\nThere's a lot of good here. The film looks great, especially when it's in Athens. The location photography, and rich use of shadows give it a terrific sense of atmosphere. The cast is solid too. Mitchum is great as a reluctant hero. Stanley Baker is even better as the Gestapo Agent charged with capturing Mitchum. Cap it off with Sebastian Cabot channeling Sidney Greenstreet in the best way possible and this should have been a good movie.\n\nBut, in the end, _The Angry Hills_ isn't really a movie at all.  It starts as a Hitchcockian spy thriller. But before it can get going, it drops that premise and sets up an action picture. And before _that_ can pay off, it tries out a heist picture. Had it followed through on any of these premises, it would likely have turned out better[^1]. Instead we\u2019re given the beginning of one movie, the middle of another, and the end of yet another. Quite a disappointment given the talent involved.\n\n[^1]: Okay, maybe not the wartime action premise.

It's not possible to talk about _The One I Love_ in a meaningful way without them. But it\u2019s a movie best seen with an open mind. So I encourage you, if you haven't seen it, to do so. It's not perfect, but the first two acts are brilliant and it's original enough to warrant a look. Go ahead, I'll wait.\n\nBack? Okay, here we go.\n\nMark Duplass and Elisabeth Moss play Ethan and Sophie, a young couple on the brink of divorce. They've drifted apart. Their counselor sends them to a remote retreat for a weekend getaway. He believes it\u2019s just what they need to reconnect and rediscover one another.\n\nThe retreat turns out to be a sizable country estate, complete with pool and guest house. Ethan and Sophie arrive and discover they're the only people present. They settle in, have a nice dinner, and smoke some marijuana.\n\nSophie wanders over to the guest house.  Ethan joins her. They laugh, talk and have a wonderful time. The best they've had in years. They have sex. Later, Sophie heads back to the main house to grab some things. Inside, she's surprised to find Ethan lying on the couch.\n\nShe laughs and asks how he's beaten her back. Ethan looks confused. He's just woken up. Sophie stops laughing. She asks him why he's acting like this after they just has sex. Ethan looks at her with bewilderment. He tells her he's been asleep on the couch since they smoked the marijuana. Sophie storms off, furious at Ethan's unfunny joke.\n\nEthan wanders over to the guest house and falls asleep on the couch there. In the middle of the night, Sophie joins him. They snuggle. Ethan wakes to find Sophie making breakfast. Including bacon. Sophie hates bacon.\n\nUp to this point, the film has cultivated a subtle aura of menace. The long shadow-filled shots of Sophie walking back to the house and through the empty kitchen wouldn't seem out of place in a home invasion thriller.\n\nBut now we've got an inkling of what's going on, and to the film's credit, it doesn't drag things out.  Ethan and Sophie soon realize that when one of them enters the guest house alone, they're greeted by a doppelg\u00e4nger of the other.\n\nThey run. Again, credit to the film. It's what most folks would do. But then Ethan and Sophie get to thinking about it. Especially Sophie. They talk. The film's tone shifts from menacing to quirky. Sophie suggests going back. Weren't they there to try new things? Ethan agrees. They return to the retreat and set some ground rules for the guest house. Fifteen minute sessions, no intimate activity. Total honesty.\n\nOf course, these rules soon go out the window. Sophie begins sneaking out to see the other Ethan. Ethan ends up impersonating his doppelg\u00e4nger in order to sleep with Sophie.\n\nLater, Ethan gets some voicemails from friends and family members. The messages suggest that Ethan made a series of calls in the middle of the night asking random questions about his past. Some of his clothes seem to have gone missing as well.\n\nSoon the doppelg\u00e4ngers confront Ethan and Sophie as a couple. The four try to have a nice dinner, but Ethan's suspicion and resentment bubble over. He storms off to the guest house. Once inside, he finds he can't get out.\n\nIn time, Sophie's doppelg\u00e4nger arrives. Then the film falls apart.\n\nUp to this point, the doppelg\u00e4ngers felt like a novel device the script employed to visualize Ethan and Sophie's perceptions of one another. This sort of thing could feel like a gimmick and veer into into cheesy fantasy, but the film stays grounded by focusing on the harsh realities of trying to make a relationship work.\n\nTo this end, the doppelg\u00e4ngers require no explanation. They exist to serve the story. The film even floats this notion, suggesting that some things \u201cJust happen.\u201d\n\nBut the movie isn't confident enough to leave it at that. And so Sophie's doppelg\u00e4nger reveals the truth to Ethan. Her and Doppelg\u00e4nger Ethan were another couple sent to the retreat like Ethan and Sophie, but now they're trapped. The only way they can leave is to break up Ethan and Sophie so they can take their place. But something's gone wrong. The other Ethan has fallen in love with the real Sophie. He's planning to leave with her.\n\nAfter that wealth of exposition, the plot kicks in. Doppelg\u00e4nger Sophie lets Ethan out of the guest house and distracts Doppelg\u00e4nger Ethan (by posing as the real Sophie) so that Ethan can warn Sophie. When Sophie refuses to leave with him, Doppelg\u00e4nger Ethan tries leaving by himself. An invisible wall knocks him cold. Ethan and Sophie leave.\n\nThe next we see, they're lying in bed giggling. Sophie gets up and offers to make breakfast, asking if Ethan wants bacon.\n\nThe film name-drops _The Twilight Zone_ but the first two acts are more reminiscent of David Lynch's work.  Like Lynch's _Lost Highway (1997)_ and _Mulholland Dr. (1999)_, _The One I Love_ explores the subject of identity through a strange, inexplicable event. But the difference is that in Lynch's films, the character's motivations are never explicitly verbalized. If you define them, the rest of the story must serve them. When it doesn\u2019t, you have plot holes.\n\nAnd boy does _The One I Love_ have a lot of them. The whole film doesn't make any sense, really. What was the point of imprisoning couples there? Why transform the previous couples into doppelg\u00e4ngers of the next ones? Why can they only leave after the other two have broken up? Why did their therapist send them in the first place?\n\nDespite all this, _The One I Love_ impressed me. It's a brilliant concept that's handled with the perfect tone. That it goes off the rails at the end doesn't detract from the great performances and it's biting insight into relationships. The plot holes don\u2019t ruin the movie, they just handicap it.\n\nNow, just imagine if it didn't try to explain the doppelg\u00e4ngers. Imagine if the scene where Ethan hears the other couple's voices turning into his and Sophie's was left out. Imagine if when Ethan confronted doppelg\u00e4nger Sophie about not being real, she just sat and stared at him with that slightly unnatural smile. Then cut to the scene of Ethan and Sophie back home in bed laughing and Sophie getting up to make breakfast.\n\nI suppose this ending would leave some portion of the audience wanting. Lynch\u2019s films are famous for that. They\u2019re like lego sets. They provide the audience with the building blocks of a story, but leave it to the viewer to create their own interpretation and meaning. Unfortunately, _The One I Love_ is less like a set of legos and more like a puzzle.

After landing, he and the Duke set out to call on their young friend, Simon. What they find upon arriving at Simon's palatial house alarms the Duke. It seems Simon has fallen in with a group of Satanists led by the sinister Mocata, played by Charles Gray. As the Duke says, \u201cSimon is playing the most dangerous game known to mankind.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s dialog is full of lines like that. They should induce groans, but Lee pulls them off with flair. He opens the commentary track on the DVD saying that he\u2019s largely responsible for the film being made. He was a big fan of the novel by Dennis Wheatley and brought the book to the attention of studio executives. His performance is reminiscent of Peter Cushing\u2019s turn as Van Helsing in _Horror of Dracula (1958)_, and his admiration of the source material shines through.\n\nOpposite Lee, Gray delivers a smooth, understated performance that\u2019s almost as magnetic as Lee's[^1].

Rasputin gets good and drunk and takes the innkeeper's daughter out to the barn. This doesn't sit well with her young suitor who brawls with Rasputin.

It treats the character of Rasputin as a one-dimensional monster. This wouldn\u2019t be so bad, but the talky script vacillates between biographical drama and horror without committing to either.

Aboard an ocean liner that's just docked in Veracruz, Mexico, William Bendix bursts into Robert Mitchum's cabin holding a gun. He's after something he believes Mitchum stole. Mitchum says he doesn't have it. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong man,\u201d Mitchum says. Bendix isn\u2019t buying it. He moves to arrest Mitchum. Mitchum overpowers Bendix, knocking him out. Mitchum takes Bendix's gun and identification. The identification reads: Captain Vincent Blake of the US Army.\n\nAfter debarking, Mitchum crosses paths with Jane Greer. It's a short meeting, as Mitchum has to duck out of sight as Bendix emerges from the ship. Once the coast is clear, Mitchum tries to catch a cab, only to find Greer has gotten the last one.\n\nCut to a room inside the Hotel Mexico. We see Patric Knowles packing. He\u2019s in a rush. His eyes are darting around. There's a knock at the door. Knowles pulls a gun and moves to the side of the door, ready to plug whoever comes in. Then we hear Greer's voice, telling him to open up. We learn that Knowles is Greer's fiancee. But she's not there to marry him, she's there because he ran off with her savings, about two thousand dollars. She wants it back.\n\nKnowles tries to sweet talk her, but Greer cuts him off saying, \"The last time you did that it cost me my bank account.\" Knowles tries to make her feel bad for harping on him about the money saying, \"There's that dollar sign again.\" But Greer snaps back, \"Where? I don't see it. Come on, hand it over.\" Then, dripping with sarcasm, \"I was saving that money for my trousseau.\u201d\n\nKnowles gives Greer the slip, and a few beats later we learn that Mitchum is after Knowles too.\n\nThus, the film is set. It\u2019s one big chase. Bendix chases Mitchum who, along with Greer, chases Knowles. Mitchum and Greer form an uneasy partnership as they travel across the Mexican countryside from Veracruz to Tehuac\u00e1n[^1].  As the story unfolds we learn what was stolen, and who did the stealing. Mitchum and Greer warm to each other. Everything culminates in a surprising, but satisfying finale.\n\nOn paper, it's another forgettable lower-budget entry from RKO, the once premier studio that had fallen to disarray under Howard Hughes. But thanks to a crackerjack script, _The Big Steal_ is better than it probably had any right to be.\n\nConsider how little information we're given as the movie begins. Rather than open with a flashback or exposition, we\u2019re thrown right into one unnamed man confronting another over an event we know nothing about. That\u2019s great storytelling. But it\u2019s when Greer confronts Knowles that the script really sparkles.\n\nIt's refreshing to see such an independent female character. She's self assured without being arrogant. Insistent without being whiny. The script may leave the fisticuffs to the men, but Greer's character holds her own in the numerous bouts of verbal sparring.\n\nThe script also does a great job of subverting our expectations. From the anything-but-inept Mexican police inspector, to Greer\u2014not Mitchum\u2014being the one to get them out of various jams, the script defies the genre\u2019s conventions.\n\nAnd topping it all off, there's a nice touch where Mitchum actually wears some of the results of his tussles. From a bloody nose to a beaten face, the film\u2019s fights have visible consequences. Something all too rare in Hollywood.\n\nGranted, it's not a perfect film. The extended car chase feels tacked on and forced. And Knowles and Bendix don't quite hold their own against Mitchum and Greer in terms of star wattage. But really, these are weaknesses instead of faults. _The Big Steal_ takes a B-movie plot and elevates it to near greatness thanks to a well-crafted script peppered with crackling dialog.\n\n[^1]: They actually shot in Mexico, which helps to belie the film\u2019s modest budget.", "slug": "the-big-steal-1949"}, {"file_path": "reviews/the-town-that-dreaded-sundown-2014.md", "sequence": 27, "imdb_id": "tt2561546", "title": "The Town That Dreaded Sundown", "year": 2014, "date": "2015-02-06", "grade": "C+", "review_content": "\n_The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ starts with a prologue recounting a series of unsolved murders that occurred in Texarkana in 1946. It talks about how those killings formed the basis for the original film, _The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976)_, which screens every Halloween somewhere in Texarkana.\n\nThe film opens on one of those screenings. It's a drive-in. The camera pans down to a teen couple sitting on the hood of a car. He seems into the film, but she looks uneasy. She says it\u2019s not her kind of movie. He asks her if she wants to go. She does, and they head out. As they leave, the camera picks up a preacher imploring the patrons to remember that people really died back in 1946.\n\nThe couple head out for a quiet, deserted area where they can be alone. He makes small talk as they drive. The camera shows them at a tilted angle. It's an on-the-nose gimmick that foreshadows one of the film's biggest weaknesses.\n\nSoon they're parked. They start kissing, but the girl spots a man in the nearby woods. He's dressed just like the killer from the movie. But this is no prank. The man breaks the car's window with the butt of a revolver. He orders them out of the car at gunpoint, then forces the girl to turn around while he stabs the boy to death.\n\nAnd we're off and running. By genre definitions, the film is a slasher, but I'm always hesitant to use that term. For many people, that equates to the _Friday the 13th_ and _Halloween_ series of films, which were, for the most part, more monster and survival-horror films than slasher. _The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ is more of a violent mystery. Victims are stalked and murdered in a brutal but stylish manner and we work along with the protagonist to deduce the killer's identity from a number of suspects. To that end, _The Town That Dreaded Sundown_ may be the first rural giallo.\n\nThere's a lot to like. The supporting cast includes Edward Herrmann as the aforementioned preacher, and Gary Cole as a sheriff\u2019s deputy.\n\nThe script\u2019s meta-sequel approach works well. It avoids the trap of aggrandizing the original film by regulating it to well-researched pulp entertainment. Granted, this film does play as something of a remake, but by excising the original\u2019s head-scratching bits of comic relief, this entry crafts a much taunter narrative.\n\nBut the film is far from perfect. Remember the gimmick shot I mentioned earlier? The movie is full of them. Some of them work, but their impact is lost in the shuffle.\n\nConsider the scene, set at night, where a woman flees the killer into a huge wheat field. The killer has a gun. He fires and she drops to the ground amid the wheat. He approaches, but can\u2019t find the body. Cut to a bird\u2019s eye shot of the field and we see the woman crawling away from the killer as he stalks forward. They\u2019re not more than six feet apart, but they can\u2019t see each other. The shot\u2019s only held for a few moments before we cut back to a tight shot of the killer.\n\nWhy? That was a great shot. Keep it. Cut the music. Just give us the sound of the wind and let us watch from above as she crawls, hoping against hope that he doesn\u2019t see her. Their meeting is inevitable, but the tension would have been palpable watching the two skew towards one another.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the ending.\n\nBut before we get to that, let me say that I liked the movie. The location photography, colorful supporting cast, and competent script make for a solid little slasher. So, having said that, and having given you a sense of what the film is about and what it\u2019s like, I feel my job as reviewer is done. If you want to stop reading here, I\u2019ll understand.\n\nStill with me? Okay. I didn\u2019t love the ending. I didn\u2019t hate it either. It felt like a missed opportunity.\n\nHere\u2019s why. The script touches on the notion of violence inspired by the media several times, but only in passing. I felt the film was building to something however, and when the heroine makes to leave town with her grandmother, it struck me. What if this is the end of the movie? She leaves and the killer is never caught. The end. All the bits about inspired violence coalesce into a biting commentary. The killer will be there as long as he has an audience. It would even dovetail nicely with the original's ambiguous ending.\n\nSure, some folks would hate it, but I bet a lot of theater-goers hated the original\u2019s ending too. And yet, that ending helped the original resonate enough to inspire a remake almost forty years later.", "slug": "the-town-that-dreaded-sundown-2014"}, {"file_path": "reviews/the-crimson-cult-1968.md", "sequence": 28, "imdb_id": "tt0062833", "title": "The Crimson Cult", "year": 1968, "date": "2015-02-09", "grade": "D+", "review_content": "\n_Curse of the Crimson Altar_ (_The Crimson Cult_ here in the USA) has a good cast, but it is not a good film. This is evident from the opening scene.\n\nA droning hum whines in and out as a young man named Peter Manning stands wearing a suit. He looks dazed. In front of him, a nude woman suffers a whip while lying strapped to a table. Men in black robes look on. One has a goat. Wearing a large headdress complete with ram horns, a green-skinned Barbra Steel introduces herself as Lavinia, the \"Keeper of the Black Secret\u201d[^1]. She asks if Peter knows why he's there. He does. She asks if he's ready to sign. He is. A man brings over a large book and Peter signs his name. Then Lavinia hands Peter a dagger. Peter stabs the girl on the table. There's a quick-cut to the goat, which seems distressed. Lavinia snaps her fingers. There's a crack of thunder. A muscular man dressed in a leather bikini bottom, leather arm-bands, and a studded leather cap sprouting deer antlers brings over a branding iron which he presses into Peter's chest.\n\nYes, that happens. The film packs a few more of these trippy, S&M-tinged sequences, but they exist more-or-less outside the main narrative.\n\nThe story concerns Peter's brother, Robert, played by Mark Eden. When Peter doesn't return home, Robert goes looking for him at his last known location, a remote country estate called Craxton Lodge. Robert's arrival coincides with a local festival celebrating the burning of the witch Lavinia some three hundred years earlier. The estate\u2019s owner, J.D. Morely, played by Christopher Lee, claims to have never heard of Peter, but invites Robert to stay on to continue his search. Robert agrees. Robert also meets another of the locals, Professor Marsh, played by Boris Karloff. Marsh, conveniently, is an expert on witchcraft.\n\nAs the film unwinds, the tone veers between cult conspiracy and Scooby-Doo mystery. Robert discovers secret doors and a fake spiderweb machine en-route to learning the truth behind his brother\u2019s disappearance. But by the time the credits roll we're left wondering if the scenes with Lavinia were meant to be real or imagined.\n\nSometimes ambiguity helps a film resonate. But in this case, it only serves to underscore the film's patronizing approach to its horror elements. Consider the poor attempt at meta-humor. When one of the characters compares Craxton Lodge to \u201cone of those old houses in horror films,\u201d Robert replies, \u201cIt\u2019s like Boris Karloff\u2019s going to pop up at any moment.\u201d\n\nAfter my first viewing of _The Curse of the Crimson Altar_ , I considered it something of a guilty pleasure. The over-the-top dream sequences and gratuitous nudity were good for a chuckle.\n\nBut watching it a second time, I found the film far less entertaining. Sure, Karloff is great. Even wheelchair-bound at eighty-years-old, he could still command a scene. But that\u2019s about all this movie has going for it. Lee\u2019s role gives him little to do, and Barbara Steele is wasted. The story\u2019s mystery elements, already weak on the first viewing, border on tedious the second time around.\n\nGiven that this was one of Karloff\u2019s final films, it\u2019s probably required viewing for any serious fan of classic horror. Just don't watch it a second time.\n\n[^1]: For the record, there is no _Crimson_ Altar or _Crimson_ Cult.", "slug": "the-crimson-cult-1968"}, {"file_path": "reviews/where-danger-lives-1950.md", "sequence": 29, "imdb_id": "tt0043131", "title": "Where Danger Lives", "year": 1950, "date": "2015-02-14", "grade": "F", "review_content": "\nI usually warn folks when I\u2019m going to spoil plot points, but in the case of _Where Danger Lives_, I don't think it matters. This is one of those films where the hero takes the entire movie to deduce what the audience figures out in the first ten minutes.\n\nThe film opens with doctor Jeff Cameron treating a little girl. Jeff is telling her a story about elephants. Robert Mitchum plays Jeff. He\u2019s miscast in a part that would better suit Henry Fonda, but that\u2019s the least of the film\u2019s problems.\n\nAfter finishing with the little girl, Jeff clocks out, eager for  his date with Julie, a nice nurse who works at the hospital. But Jeff has to cancel after he's called to assist with a new patient.\n\nThe patient is Margo, a not-so-wholesome girl who\u2019d just attempted suicide. Jeff treats Margo, then the two start dating. He falls hard. Faith Domergue plays Margo. Like Mitchum, she\u2019s miscast. But unlike Mitchum, it\u2019s hard to overlook just how wrong she is for the role. To be fair, it\u2019s a hard part to play.\nMargo has to do more than seduce Jeff, she has to seduce the entire audience. We have to buy Jeff overlooking a myriad of red flags and throwing his life away for a woman he just met.\n\nBut we don\u2019t buy it. The entire romance is unconvincing.\n\nSoon Margo breaks it to Jeff that she has to leave for Nassau. It seems her father has come home, and upon finding out about Jeff, decided it best that Margo take a trip.\n\nJeff doesn\u2019t take it well. He has a few too many and goes to Margo\u2019s house. He confronts her father, Mr. Lannington, played by third-billed Claude Rains in his only scene. Here, Jeff discovers the first of many things we already suspected. Lannington isn't her father at all, but her husband![^1]\n\nJeff and Lannington get into a scuffle. Jeff knocks down Lannington who gets back up and pummels Jeff with a fireplace poker. Jeff clocks Lannington, knocking him out cold. Jeff, still reeling, stumbles to the bathroom for some water. When he returns, Margo tells Jeff that Lannington is dead.[^1]\n\nNow, at this point it's obvious to us that Margo killed her husband while Jeff was out of the room. But, since the rest of the film hinges on Jeff believing he did it, a series of contrived plot machinations are necessary. As the film rolls on the pair will \u201djust miss\" the news. The car radio won\u2019t work. Someone will draw a beard on Margo\u2019s police picture, preventing her from being recognized.\n\nAnyway, Margo convinces Jeff to make a run for the Mexico border. Jeff agrees. The film explains this by having Jeff tell us he has a concussion. This is the worst concussion you've ever seen. Jeff blacks out, loses the ability to think straight, and by the time the film's predictable conclusion rolls around, finds the left side of his body paralyzed.\n\nFrom here the film shifts to a road movie. Margo and Jeff prowl through the small, out-of-the-way towns of the southwest and descend into a kind of backwoods hell. In one town they\u2019re nearly thrown in jail after a fender-bender with a drunken immigrant. In another they\u2019re brought before the town sheriff for being clean shaven during \u201cWhiskers Week.\u201d\n\nEventually, the film tells us that Margo is crazy. It\u2019s played as a big reveal, but we\u2019ve known it all along. After all, didn\u2019t Jeff meet her because she\u2019d tried to commit suicide?\n\nEverything wraps up near the Mexico border. Jeff and Margo are holed up in a dingy hotel room. Margo reveals she\u2019d been stashing Lannington\u2019s money in a Mexican bank. Jeff finally realizes that Margo killed Lannington. Margo smothers Jeff with a pillow and heads for the border. She\u2019s almost across when she sees Jeff shambling down the street toward her. She begs him to stop, to not come any further.\n\nDomergue doesn\u2019t look like a desperate woman, she looks like an actress unsure of what to do. \u201cDon\u2019t make me shoot,\u201d she says to no one as she pulls a small revolver from her purse.\n\nJeff keeps coming. Margo shoots and misses. The border guards shoot Margo, who dies, but not before confessing to the authorities that she killed Lannington alone. Jeff wakes up in a hospital. He\u2019s going to be okay. Julie is there waiting.\n\n_Where Danger Lives_ isn\u2019t as awful as it is frustrating. The film treats us like simpletons, expecting us to swallow one trite plot twist after another while ignoring Domergue\u2019s stilted performance. I tried, but I just couldn\u2019t do it. Maybe a concussion would have helped.\n\n[^1]: Cue ominous music: _Duh-duh-dum!_", "slug": "where-danger-lives-1950"}, {"file_path": "reviews/kingsman-the-secret-service-2014.md", "sequence": 30, "imdb_id": "tt2802144", "title": "Kingsman: The Secret Service", "year": 2014, "date": "2015-02-23", "grade": "C+", "review_content": "\n_Kingsman: The Secret Service_ tells the story of a young man named Gary who goes by Eggsy. We\u2019re never told how he got this nickname. The film is full of superfluous bits like this.\n\nEggsy lives with his mother and infant sister in one of London\u2019s ailing housing projects. His father died when he was just a toddler. These days, his mother has taken up with a low-level hood who degrades her and bullies Eggsy.\n\nWhen a rare moment of defiance lands Eggsy in jail, Eggsy calls a mysterious number his mother gave him should he ever find himself in trouble. Shortly thereafter, Eggsy walks out of jail a free man. Outside the police station, Eggsy meets Harry Hart.\n\nHarry, played by Colin Firth, is a dapper gentleman cut from the David Niven cloth. The two go for a pint. Harry tells Eggsy that Eggsy\u2019s father was a Kingsman, a member of an elite group of gentleman super-spies. He died saving Harry\u2019s life. Eggsy is incredulous until he sees Harry take down a group of young thugs using nothing but an umbrella. Before he leaves, Harry offers Eggsy a chance to try out for the Kingsmen.\n\nAnd so Eggsy goes to spy-school. In keeping with the dapper gentleman theme, spy-school is more like boarding school than boot camp. When they're not practicing with sniper rifles or parachuting out of planes, the fresh-faced recruits wear uniforms resembling flannel suit pajamas.\n\nOf course, every spy story needs a super villain. Here we\u2019re given Richmond Valentine, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Valentine is an internet billionaire who speaks with a lisp, hates the sight of blood, and dresses like a teenager. Convinced mankind is a virus doomed to destroy the planet, Valentine plans to wipe out eighty-five percent of the human race. Naturally, he\u2019ll pick the fifteen percent that will survive.\n\nAnd every super villain needs a colorful henchman. Valentine has Gazelle, a double leg amputee whose prosthetics also act as swords capable of slicing a man in half. Spoiler alert: she slices someone in half.\n\nAs the film builds to the inevitable confrontation between Eggsy and Valentine, it becomes increasingly ludicrous. Gazelle dismembers an armed cadre of elite security officers. Harry single-handedly kills a church full of people. Eggsy picks off Valentine\u2019s henchman while somersaulting through the air in slow motion. Heads explode in a rainbow spray of gore.\n\nSure, it's silly, but the juxtaposition of the mild mannered Firth and the comical violence leaves the film with nowhere to go but over-the-top. There's even a scene between Firth and Samuel L. Jackson where they have a black-tie dinner consisting of Big Macs. I can't imagine anyone but Firth pulling that off.\n\nBut casting Firth is not without its downsides. With someone like Clive Owen, the film could have gone with a more serious and cynical tone. The script flirts with having something to say about elitism and class hierarchy, but it\u2019s lost amid the silliness.\n\nAs I said earlier, the film is full of superfluous bits. There are characters with no payoff. Roxy, another Kingsmen recruit seems to exist only to make Eggsy seem nicer than the other male recruits. She's an afterthought by the time we reach the finale. And then there are the plot holes. Like how an ultra secret organization allows most of its recruiting class to walk away after failing to make the cut. Or how an intelligence organization like the Kingsmen doesn\u2019t have its own satellites. This is sloppy storytelling, but one is hard-pressed to care given the film\u2019s relentless spectacle.\n\nIn the end, _Kingsman: The Secret Service_ is little more than an adolescent male super-spy fantasy. That said, it\u2019s not bad. It's a throwback to the days when James Bond seemed to relish his job and the films favored adventure over angst.

We\u2019re inside an apartment building on the working-class side of the tracks. We hear gunshots. A man staggers out of a unit holding his gut and tumbles down the stairs. The police arrive. They attempt to extract the shooter. Through a door, the shooter says he wants to be left alone. We recognize the voice as Henry Fonda\u2019s.\n\nThrough flashbacks, we learn that Henry Fonda plays Joe, a veteran recently returned from World War II. He\u2019s a wholesome guy. He drinks milk and uses exclamations like, \u201cNo kidding!\u201d\n\nOne day, while working as a sandblaster at the local plant, Joe meets a young girl named Jo Anne, played by Barbara Bel Geddes. Joe and Jo Anne hit it off. The film would have us believe this is natural since they\u2019re both orphans and they\u2019re both named Joe. They begin dating. Joe falls hard.\n\nOne night, Jo Anne cancels a date with Joe. She has something to do. Joe says that\u2019s fine, but takes Jo Anne\u2019s favorite stuffed animal hostage as a bit of insurance that she\u2019ll see him again. It\u2019s a nice touch that gives Joe some edge and helps make the film\u2019s later events more plausible.\n\nJoe ends up tailing Jo Anne to a dingy club where a magician is performing. Vincent Price plays the magician. We recognize him as the man who was shot during the film\u2019s opening.\n\nAt the bar, Joe meets Charlene, played by Ann Dvorak. Through Charlene, we learn the magician\u2019s name is Maximilian. Charlene was one of his assistants. She\u2019s just now decided to leave him, having grown tired of his manipulative ways.\n\nJoe watches Jo Anne. She seems enraptured by Maximilian\u2019s performance and approaches him after the show. Maximilian\u2019s tells her to meet him at his table. Joe\u2019s seen enough.\n\nBefore joining Jo Anne, however, Maximilian approaches Joe and Charlene at the bar. It\u2019s here we get our first taste of Maximilian\u2019s condescending wit. He tries to cajole Charlene into changing her mind. Joe tells Maximilian to scram. Maximilian replies with a sarcastic grin, \u201cMy friend, there is no one I would like disagreeing with more than you. However, under the circumstances, there\u2019s hardly any point in continuing our conversation.\u201d Then, to Charlene, \u201cTill tomorrow, my dear.\u201d\n\nCharlene develops a torch for Joe. Joe, feeling hurt by Jo Anne, uses Charlene for companionship. She\u2019s more or less emotional collateral damage by the film\u2019s end. Dvorak makes the most of a part that exists only to show Joe turning to the dark side when he thinks he\u2019s lost Jo Anne.\n\nAs the story goes on, we learn the depths of Maximilian\u2019s debauchery. How he\u2019s seduced and manipulated countless naive young girls like Jo Anne. Each new bit of knowledge cuts at Joe.\n\nIt all builds to a showdown between Joe and Maximilian. The confrontation doesn\u2019t disappoint. Price is great in the part despite being a decade too young. Like all of Price\u2019s best roles, he plays a showman, one capable of immense charm on stage, and immense debauchery off stage. He talks circles around Fonda, each word dripping with condescension. Fonda plays on this, his frustration building and building until it boils over.\n\nWhich brings us to where we came in. And here\u2019s where movie goes wrong. The tone shifts from noir to populist drama. The town rallies around Joe in his standoff with the police. Jo Anne fights through a never-ending mob in an effort to reach Joe. She\u2019s knocked down by someone carrying a bicycle. Won\u2019t the police please just let her talk to Joe, she pleads. But they won\u2019t. Which leads to more shots of Jo Anne fighting her way through the crowd. As if this all weren\u2019t bad enough, the film closes on a cornball line. As he\u2019s escorted out by the police, Joe asks one of the crowd for a light. The man lights Joe\u2019s cigarette and asks, \u201cHow you doing, Joe?\u201d Joe replies, \u201cI think we\u2019ll make it, Freddy.

The studio rose to prominence with films such as _Curse of Frankenstein (1957)_ and _Horror of Dracula (1958)_. Unlike those staged, period pieces, this film is set in contemporary times and shot on location. It represented a big departure for Hammer, but it was too little too late.\n\nThe story\u2014ah, well, you\u2019ll have to bear with me here. I\u2019ve seen the movie twice and I\u2019m still not sure about some of the details. According the featurette on Anchor Bay\u2019s DVD, the filmmaker\u2019s were writing the script as they went along. It shows in the final product.\n\nAs near as I can tell, Father Michael, played by Christopher Lee, is a priest who commits the heresy of putting his faith in man over God. To that end\u2014and here\u2019s where things get fuzzy\u2014he retreats to a compound in Bavaria where he forms his own Satanic religion which masquerades as Catholicism. One of his acolytes dies during childbirth and Father Michael baptizes the baby, a girl, in her dead mother\u2019s blood. The girl, Catherine, grows up as a nun in Father Michael\u2019s compound. On her eighteenth birthday she travels to London. There, Father Michael will baptize her in the blood of a demon creature birthed by another of Father Michael\u2019s acolytes[^2].\n\nBut, fortunately for humanity, Catherine\u2019s father, Henry, has a change of heart. Henry appeals to occult novelist John Verney, played by Richard Widmark. Verney intercepts Catherine at Heathrow airport. Verney had hoped to get a book out of Henry\u2019s story, but soon realizes the stakes are much higher.\n\nFather Michael attempts to reclaim Catherine by possessing her. Verney tries to keep her safe. During the tug-of-war we\u2019re presented with a couple of disturbing scenes.\n\nThe first concerns the birth of the demon creature. Picture a staged, antiseptic facsimile of a young girl's bedroom. On the bed, a woman prepares to give birth. Strips of white cloth bind her wrists to the headboard and clamp her knees and ankles shut, giving the baby no escape. Arms spread, knees clenched, she lays crucified. Her face glistens with sweat as her back arches and her body spasms from another contraction. Her belly swells. Beside her, Father Michael stands waiting, smiling with eager eyes.\n\nAnd later, we see one of Catherine\u2019s visions/dreams. We\u2019re looking through her eyes. She\u2019s pregnant and laying on her back. We see her bulging womb. Her legs are open, knees up, in the traditional birthing position. Still through her eyes, we see something crawling up from between her legs. At first glimpse it seems to be a baby, but no, it's a horrid combination of baby and beast with a monstrous jaw and reptilian eyes. Covered in blood, it writhes between her legs, smearing her thighs and stomach with gore. She reaches down and strokes the creature's grotesque head. Now her midsection is awash in thick, almost syrupy, blood as she gently pushes the thing back down, between her legs. Still through her eyes, we hear her moan in a mixture of agony and ecstasy as she forces the monstrosity _back up into her womb_.\n\nThe quality of the creature effects in this scene is laughable. And what\u2019s worse the scene has little to do with the story. Instead, it feels like something tacked on as a reaction to _Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1968)_ and _The Exorcist (1973)_.\n\nAnd it\u2019s when you compare this film to those, that one realizes how far Hammer had fallen.\n\nThis was a studio that, nineteen years prior, had revived the horror genre by injecting a liberal dose of gore and sex into the monster movie. The resulting films were edgy and fresh.\n\nBut time passed. Those kids who flocked theaters for Hammer\u2019s earlier films now had kids of their own. To this new generation, Hammer\u2019s period monster movies were pass\u00e9. They were your _parent\u2019s_ horror movies. Even this wave of satanic themed films was on it\u2019s nadir. Two years later _Halloween (1978)_ would usher in the slasher genre that would dominate horror for the next decade.\n\nBy the time Hammer woke up and tried to tap into the mainstream horror pulse, it lacked the resources to pull off a competent film. Christopher Lee does his best, but Richard Widmark looks tired and annoyed. He\u2019s just cashing a paycheck.\n\nThe worst part is the ending. Remember how I said they were writing the script as they went along? As it turns out, they ran out of money by the time they got to the end. After an hour and a half of buildup, Verney and Father Michael square off in a mausoleum. Father Michael stands in a large circle made of blood.\n\nSays Verney, \u201cYou really think this circle will protect you, don\u2019t you? It won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it will,\u201d says Father Michael. \u201cBecause this circle stands upon a hill of flint, and flint is the sacred stone of Astaroth.\u201d\n\nVerney holds up a rock he literally just picked up five minutes earlier and used to club one of Father Michael\u2019s henchman. \u201cBut this sacred stone of Astaroth has the blood of your disciple on it. Now, the demons will protect me.\u201d\n\nVerney steps into the circle and throws the rock at Father Michael, hitting him on the head. Father Michael falls to the ground and disappears. Movie over. That\u2019s the ending. A mumbo-jumbo bit of rock-paper-scissors involving flint and the blood of a disciple. Two bits of information _never mentioned in the film before_.\n\nIf this was the best Hammer could do, then the studio\u2019s death was a mercy killing[^3].\n\n[^1]: Until the studio was resurrected in 2008.\n[^2]: I\u2019m willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume Father Michael wasn\u2019t doing this for Satan, but for his own gain. That he\u2019s somehow brought about the birth of a demon and by baptizing Catherine in its blood, he could control its power. I know that\u2019s reaching, but I\u2019ve got a soft spot for Hammer.\n[^3]: Okay, so the studio didn\u2019t _die_, it just produced television instead of movies.", "slug": "to-the-devil-a-daughter-1976"}, {"file_path": "reviews/a-girl-walks-home-alone-at-night-2014.md", "sequence": 33, "imdb_id": "tt2326554", "title": "A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night", "year": 2014, "date": "2015-03-06", "grade": "A-", "review_content": "\n_A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night_ bills itself as the first Iranian Vampire Western. This is misleading. Like all good movies, it transcends borders.

It\u2019s a place where the dead lay dumped in dried river beds like so much garbage. Its streets alternate between rows of cookie-cutter homes and desolate alleyways. In the distance, oil rigs pump up and down like crows picking at the dead earth\u2019s skin.\n\nWe follow a group of colorful characters with intersecting stories. There\u2019s Arash, a young man who dresses in white t-shirts and pegged jeans. His prized possession is a 1957 Ford Thunderbird convertible he worked 2,191 days to afford. Arash\u2019s father, Hossein, is a widower and heroin addict. Hossein\u2019s dealer, Saeed has the word \u201cSEX\u201d tattooed across the front of his throat. Saeed is also a pimp for Atti, who\u2019s just turned thirty and dreams of escaping the life of a street walker.\n\nWeaving through these narratives is the girl. She\u2019s a vampire. She lives in a small, one-room apartment. New-wave posters plaster the walls. At night she emerges in a pitch-black chador to prey on the city\u2019s destitute and depraved. There is a loneliness in her that actress Sheila Vand conveys despite having little dialog.\n\nArash and the girl\u2019s paths cross, first in passing then again in one of the film\u2019s cleverest scenes. Arash has been to a costume party and gotten lost walking home. He\u2019s high on Ecstasy, staring open mouthed at a streetlight when the girl spots him. He\u2019s wearing a Dracula costume that prompts something of a double-take by her. Their eyes meet. There is a connection. They sense the loneliness in one-another. In a near wordless scene, she takes him back to her small apartment. She puts on a record and he holds her close, wanting nothing more than the company. It is something out of a teenage fantasy, yet the scene works because the film doesn\u2019t try to sell it. There are no speeches or orchestral swells, just the two performers and the song _Death_ from White Lies.\n\nI\u2019m going to talk about the ending now. If what I\u2019ve written so far has piqued your curiosity, I encourage you to give the film a look. I\u2019d rather not spoil the ending, but if you\u2019re still on the fence, read on and perhaps I can persuade you.\n\nStill, here? Okay, here we go.\n\nTo appreciate why _A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night_ is a great film, we must discuss the final scene.\n\nArash and the girl are driving out of town. Arash doesn't know that she's a vampire, but he knows that she killed his father. The girl doesn\u2019t know that the man she killed was Arash\u2019s father, but she knows he\u2019s having second thoughts. They drive in silence. After a bit, Arash pulls the car over. He gets out and paces in the headlights. His fists clench and unclench. He runs his hands through his hair. The emotions wash over him. The girl watches in silence. We don\u2019t fear for him, we fear for her feelings. In a Hollywood production this scene would include a monologue followed by an emotional exchange. Writer-director Ana Lily Amirpour gives us something far more powerful in the silence.\n\nIn time Arash straightens, gets back in the car and pulls onto the road. They leave Bad City.\n\nIt\u2019s a perfect ending, and one that stuck with me long after I\u2019d walked out of the theater.

But for some folks it may be worth a look. To explain why, I must venture into spoiler territory.\n\nConsider this fair warning.\n\nThe film opens with a murder. We\u2019re looking down a set of stairs into a darkened, deserted nightclub. A man sits playing a piano with his back to us. Another man appears atop the stairs. He has a gun. He sneaks down and creeps across the nightclub floor. There\u2019s a flash of lightning and a crack of thunder from the storm outside. The piano player turns, and the gunman shoots twice. The piano player drops dead. Then we hear footsteps and a woman scream. The gunman whirls towards us and fires. We hear the sound of running and a door closing. The gunman hurries after the mystery woman.\n\nNext we're in a posh high-rise office. Two weeks have passed. The rain hasn\u2019t stopped. The gunman, Johnny, sits on a couch. He pokes at a toy piano, playing the same melody the piano player played before he died.\n\nWe learn that Johnny is out on bail. He\u2019s planning to claim self-defense at the trial, but the District Attorney has a witness that could put Johnny away for a long time. Johnny thinks he knows where the witness is hiding and wants her out of the picture.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your job,\u201d Johnny says to a man sitting in a chair with his back to us. Now, here\u2019s where things get confusing. They know where the witness is hiding, but they don\u2019t know her identity. They have a guess, but they\u2019re not sure. So the mystery hitman\u2019s job is to fly out, rent a car, then go undercover. Mingle with the people and suss out the witness\u2019s identity. Then kill her, but make it look like an accident.\n\n\u201cWhat a hideout,\u201d Johnny says. \u201cNo wonder we couldn\u2019t find it until yesterday. It\u2019s the last place in the world you\u2019d expect anyone to hide.\u201d\n\nCut to Glacier National Park in Montana. We see Matt Hallett, played by Victor Mature, entering the park in a rented car. The guard at the gate spies a gun in Matt\u2019s glove compartment and phones it in to Chief Ranger Joe, played by William Bendix.\n\nFor the next half-hour or so, the film plays like a would-be suspenseful mystery. The script tries in vain to make us suspect  Matt as the hired killer. It helps that Mature has a way of talking where his entire body remains motionless except his jaw. It kept reminding me of a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy. Certainly creepy enough to be a believable sociopath.\n\nBut, of course, we know better. This would-be misdirection gives Vincent Price a chance to do what he does best, play a character playing someone else. Here, he plays Paul Adams, a mob hitman playing a nature photographer. Early on, he\u2019s all folksy smiles and good humor, but still comes off as something of a dilettante with a hint of menace.\n\nMatt and Paul both vie for the attention of the witness, Louise, played by Piper Laurie. Given that Louise is the only woman that comes close to fitting the witness\u2019s description in the entire park, I\u2019m not so sure it was such a good place to hide.\n\nLouise is cordial to Paul, but finds herself drawn to Matt. In between, there\u2019s a sub-plot involving a fugitive Indian and his daughter, an avalanche, and a forest fire.  Most of these diversions exist to exploit the film\u2019s 3D presentation. I suppose they do a decent enough job, but they also give us the impression that Glacier Park is something of a death trap.\n\nAnyway, a little before the halfway point, Paul\u2019s true identity is revealed. Though we see it coming, the scene isn\u2019t without a surprise. From here, the film shifts into adventure, as Paul has to kill Louise and flee the park. But despite being a professional killer, he fails to off Louise, and she alerts the park authorities. With all the roads closed, Paul has to flee overground.\n\nMatt, now revealed as a cop working for the New York District Attorney\u2019s office, sets out after Paul. Of course, Louise somehow ends up going with him. There\u2019s some great location photography, and everything culminates in a showdown inside an ice fissure. It\u2019s a scene that would have looked great shot in a real ice cave. Instead, the soundstage artifice is all the more glaring. You\u2019ll be hard-pressed not to laugh.\n\nAs I said, _Dangerous Mission_ is not a good movie. The convoluted script and uneven production values see to that.

The studios contracted performers and paid them a salary. The performers worked five days a week like anyone else. When one film wrapped, they moved to another. Thus, films like _Three on a Match_ came stock-piled with current and future stars.\n\nThe story begins in the fall of 1919. The film sets the time with what's now a common device, a montage of newspaper headlines.  Jack Dempsey wins the world heavyweight title. Prohibition passes. Woman's suffrage passes. Then, a smaller article. The New York City schools are set to reopen after summer vacation.\n\nCut to Public School 64. The camera pans back to reveal a schoolyard teaming with children. Hundreds of them. Were they not twirling about, playing on slides and swings, it would pass for a prison yard. Here, we meet three pre-teen girls.\n\nMary is an exhibitionist. She doesn't mind her bloomers showing while she's playing on the swing or the attention it gets from the boys. Much to the chagrin of class-beauty Vivian. When Mary skips class to smoke cigarettes with some boys, Vivian wants to tell on her. She's dissuaded by studious Ruth.\n\nTime passes with more headlines. The girls are set to graduate. Ruth is valedictorian. Vivian is voted most popular. Mary\u2019s been in so much trouble, she\u2019s almost held back.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Ruth and Vivian talk about their futures. Ruth's family can't afford her going to high school, so she's off to secretarial school so she might get a job. Vivian, however, is off to an exclusive boarding school. They both wonder what will become of Mary.\n\nMore time passes. It's 1925 now. The girls are teenagers. Mary, now played by Joan Blondell, is in reform school. Vivian, now played by Anne Dvorak is reading lewd romance novels to her rapt roommates in Miss Jasons School for Young Ladies. Ruth, now played by Bette Davis, toils away in secretarial school.\n\nNow it\u2019s 1930. Mary sits in a beauty parlor getting her hair done. She\u2019s telling her beautician how she ran into Ruth earlier that day and how she hasn\u2019t seen her since their days at Public School 64. Vivian is at the same beauty parlor and overhears Mary\u2019s mention of Public School 64. Reunited, the three women meet for lunch.\n\nSomething I love about the pictures of this era. Running just over an hour, they had to be efficient. Here, we get ten years of backstory and characterization in under five minutes.\n\nAt lunch, the girls catch up. We learn Mary has turned her life around and is now an actress who\u2019s just gotten her first break. Ruth is working as a secretary. Vivian has married a wealthy lawyer and has a three-year-old son. Mary and Ruth envy Vivian. But Vivian is restless and bored with her life.\n\nSome days later, Vivian talks her husband, Robert, into letting her travel with their son to Europe. Robert agrees, but not without some reluctance. The night they're set to sail, he sees her off. After he leaves, Vivian runs into Mary, who\u2019s now a bona-fide stage star. Mary\u2019s there seeing another friend off. Vivian has the ship's stewardess watch her son and joins Mary's party. She drinks and flirts with a young rake named Michael. Before the ship leaves port, Vivian takes her son and debarks with Michael.\n\nFrom here, Vivian descends into a drug-and-alcohol-fueled nightmare. We see her strung out on the sofa, while her son, dirty and unwashed, begs for some healthy food.\n\nMary, feeling responsible, visits Robert and tells him where to find Vivian. Robert reclaims his son and divorces Vivian.  Mary and Robert grow closer. On the day his divorce is final, he asks Mary to become his wife. Mary agrees. Ruth joins the family as a nanny.\n\nIn between, we have the obligatory pre-code shot of a woman putting on her stockings. Here, it\u2019s Bette Davis.\n\nMeanwhile, Vivian has continued her fall from grace. Michael turns out to be a gambler and the two are now desperate for money to feed their habits. Vivian, waiting outside the same uptown apartment building she used to call home, begs Mary for money. After they burn through that, Michael tries extorting Robert. When that doesn\u2019t work, Michael kidnap\u2019s Robert\u2019s son.\n\nUnfortunately for all involved, Michael owes money to a mobster named Ace, played by Edward Arnold. Ace gets wind of the plot and muscles his way in via his henchman Harve, played by Humphrey Bogart. When the heat closes in, Harve leans on Michael to off the kid. Vivian, in a moment of lucidity during her withdrawal haze, saves her son in a startling (and over the top) fashion.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of plot for 63 minutes. This is a good thing. Things move so fast we\u2019re not given much time to consider the insanity. And make no mistake, this movie is nuts. Vivian\u2019s fall from society lady to street-corner junkie plays like a caricature. Mary wastes her school years getting into trouble and ends up a society darling. Vivian spends her life doing what\u2019s expected of her and sees her world collapse the first time she steps out of line. And Ruth, poor Ruth. She works, head down, as hard as she can, only to end up working for Mary. How\u2019s that for a mixed message?\n\nBut _Three on a Match_ works despite all the crazy. Or is it because of it? I\u2019m not sure.

I endeavor to describe what a given movie is about, convey a sense of the viewing experience[^1], and give you an idea of how I felt about it.\n\nWith _The Visitor_, I am at a loss.\n\nThe film opens with a blue-eyed Christ-figure telling a story to a group of bald children. The story is about Sateen, an intergalactic criminal who fled to Earth. On Earth, Sateen mutated and developed psychic powers which he used to wreak havoc. Another alien defeated Sateen using an army of birds, but not before Sateen impregnated a slew of Earth women. Those women continued Sateen\u2019s legacy through their children. John Huston then enters the room. He says he\u2019s confirmed Sateen\u2019s latest incarnation is an eight-year-old girl in Atlanta, Georgia. He\u2019ll be leaving at once.\n\nCut to Atlanta, where we meet the aforementioned girl, Katy, her mother Barbara, and her mother\u2019s boyfriend Ray. Lance Henriksen plays Ray, continuing the film\u2019s surprising casting.\n\nKaty is, indeed, pure evil. She\u2019s got a demonic falcon who helps her off a few unfortunate souls who end up on her bad side, including a detective played by Glen Ford.\n\nIn time we learn that Ray is part of a shadowy cabal of Sateen worshippers that want Barbara to bear a son. This son would also possess the powers of Sateen and the cabal could harness them for its own ends. It\u2019s not clear why they can\u2019t use Katy, but this is a minor quibble compared to the rest of the film\u2019s plot holes.\n\nJohn Huston turns out to be the titular Visitor. He\u2019s God, who\u2019s also an alien, and presumably the one who sent the birds to destroy Sateen originally. He\u2019s not there to kill Katy, but to take her back to his world where he\u2019ll teach her not to be evil. Most of the time though, he hangs out on a skyscraper roof with a cadre of bald interpretive dancers. He gives his name as Jerzy Colsowicz and poses as a baby sitter in order to confront Katy. It\u2019s an odd confrontation. The two play Pong on a giant projection screen and dance around the fact that neither of them is human.\n\nShelly Winters plays a nanny hired by Barbara. Her scenes are notable for the instance where she slaps young Katy. According to legend, she really did slap the young girl. Hard. I like to think that it\u2019s true.\n\nCompleting some kind of bizarre casting bingo card, Sam Peckinpah turns up as Barbara\u2019s ex-husband. She visits him for an abortion after the Sateen cabal takes matters into their own hands following Ray\u2019s failure to impregnate Barbara. Unlike John Huston, who appears lucid and sober in his scenes, Peckinpah was allegedly a nightmare to work with and his scenes ended up dubbed.\n\nIf all this seems a little disjointed and bizarre, then I have successfully conveyed a sense of the viewing experience.\n\nThe horror elements are, at times, gruesome. In a scene that would make Lucio Fulci proud, a bird pecks at Glenn Ford\u2019s eyes, forcing him to crash his car. Other times, they\u2019re laughably stilted. Like when Katy makes a basketball explode on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nYet, the film is also, at times, visually striking. An early sequence will get your hopes up. A giant sun fills an orange sky. Two cloaked figures stare each other down across a desert as a sandstorm engulfs them. Scenes like this hint at greatness, but the film can\u2019t string enough of these moments together. It is equal parts fascinating and frustrating.\n\nIf nothing else, _The Visitor_ left me with a strong desire to read a biography of John Huston. If only to understand how the legendary auteur ended up starring in a film so bizarre.\n\n[^1]: As Roger Ebert said, in [Roger\u2019s Little Rule Book](http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/rogers-little-rule-book) \u201cIf it is a Pauly Shore comedy, there are people who like them, and they should be able to discover in your review if the new one is down to their usual standard.\u201d", "slug": "the-visitor-1979"}, {"file_path": "reviews/it-follows-2014.md", "sequence": 37, "imdb_id": "tt3235888", "title": "It Follows", "year": 2014, "date": "2015-04-11", "grade": "D", "review_content": "\n_It Follows_ is the perfect white-bread horror film for folks who dismiss the genre as a step or two above pornography. It's well-produced, self-aware, and devoid of any disturbing scares or gratuitous thrills.\n\nThe story opens at dusk. A girl half-dressed (but not nude) in high heels flees her suburban home. She runs into the street. Her wide eyes darting back over her shoulder. She pauses, then runs back toward her house. Her father steps outside and asks if she's okay. She says she is as she runs back inside. A moment later, she's back out. She gets into her car, backs out of the driveway, and speeds off into the darkness.\n\nShe stops at a lake and walks down to the water. She sits down with the water at her back and makes a tearful call to her parents. She apologizes for past transgressions and says she loves them.\n\nCut to the morning. The girl lies dead on the beach, her body twisted in a grotesque angle.\n\nNext, we meet our protagonist, Jay. She's a nice girl, living in suburban Detroit. She's got a younger sister, and a couple of other friends that make up her social circle. She's been dating a guy named Hugh that she's pretty sweet on.\n\nJay and Hugh go to the movies[^1], but leave when Hugh catches sight of a woman in a yellow dress. Jay doesn't see her, but a shaken Hugh insists they leave.\n\nLater that night, Jay has sex with Hugh in the backseat of his car. It's their first time together. Afterwards, Jay lies in the backseat talking to Hugh while he fumbles around in the trunk. He finds what he's looking for and climbs back into the car behind her. Hugh cuts Jay off mid-sentence by covering her mouth with a rag. Jay struggles, but soon passes out.\n\nJay wakes up tied to a wheelchair in a desolate, graffiti-covered parking garage. Hugh paces behind her, his eyes darting around. \"You're not going to believe me,\" he begins, \"but I need to you to remember what I'm saying.\"\n\nHugh tells Jay something is now following her. It doesn't run, but it's always walking in a straight line towards her. If it touches her, she's dead. It can look like anyone. Someone she knows or a complete stranger. It's a curse. Someone gave it to him, and now, by having sex with her, he's given it to her. If the thing gets her, it goes after him again, then right down the line to wherever it started. The best thing she can do now, he says, is to have sex with someone else and pass on the curse.\n\nTo prove his point, Hugh wheels Jay to the edge of the garage. In the overgrown lot below, a half-naked woman shambles toward them. Hugh waits until the thing is almost on top of them before wheeling Jay to his car. They peel out, leaving the thing behind. Hugh dumps Jay on her front lawn, still half-dressed, where her sister and friends find her.\n\nThe thing soon comes for Jay at her house. It turns out to be invisible to those not cursed, so her friends are little help as an early warning system. Jay flees to a park.\n\nFrom there, Jay and her friends retreat to a neighbor's lake house. The next day, the thing catches up with them. Despite being invisible, the thing manhandles Jay's friends when they try to stop it.\n\nOnce again, Jay flees. The film breaks the narrative circle by having Jay crash her car in a cornfield. It's the same tired trope of the girl tripping while fleeing the monster. She wakes up in a hospital. Realizing she's in danger, but too injured to leave, Jay has sex with her neighbor, passing the curse. The neighbor turns out to be pretty dim-witted. The thing gets him in a matter of days. Jay flees again and ends up passing the curse to a pair of random strangers.\n\nThe strangers don't last long. It\u2019s likely Jay never warned them, but perhaps she tried and they didn\u2019t believe her. Either way, it's soon back after Jay, but this time her friends have a plan.\n\nThey go to the local indoor pool, where Jay wades into the center of the water[^2]. After some tense waiting, the thing shows up, but refuses to enter the water. Instead, it throws things at Jay. One of her friends produces a handgun. He fires blind at where the creature might be. He wings another of Jay's friends before putting a bullet in the creature's head. The thing falls into the pool and dies trying to drag Jay under.\n\nOr does it? The film isn't over. We see Jay having sex with another of her friends. The ambiguous final shot sees the pair walking hand-in-hand while someone approaches from behind.\n\nTo be fair, this is a well-produced film dripping with atmosphere. The suburban locales evoke a lived-in feel and the Detroit cityscape reeks of urban decay. There's no hyper-kinetic editing or gimmicky found-footage. It's a slow burn. Well, maybe more like a slow singe. Given the script, I'm not sure this film could have been done any better.\n\nBut about that script.\n\nThe opening sequence reveals too much. Consider if we hadn\u2019t seen what happened to the girl waiting by the lake.  Since the creature is only visible to the cursed, the script could have played with the concept of an unreliable narrator. Is the curse real or is Jay having a breakdown? By showing the girl dead in a such a manner, the film loses any ambiguity. The curse is real.\n\nContinuing the too-much-information trend, the film then explains the details of the curse. Worse still, it does it all through dialog.  Rule #1 of good storytelling: Show, don't tell. Rule #1 of good horror: Nothing is scarier than the unknown.\n\nImagine if the film cut from Hugh holding the rag over Jay's mouth to him dumping her on the curb in front of her house. We wouldn't know what had happened to her. When the creature showed up, we'd imagine the worst. By establishing rules and limitations, the filmmakers made the curse less scary. To borrow the film's STD metaphor, it's less like AIDS in the 1980's and more like herpes today.\n\nWhich leads me to the biggest problem of all. Yes this is a horrible curse, but it's manageable. Hell, the film even seems to admit as much. If the thing just walks, then couldn't one just fly to someplace like Australia? Judging by the pool incident, it doesn't like water, which means it probably can't swim, which means you're safe.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject of nit-picks, I'm not sure when this film is set, but how do these kids not have internet access? Wouldn't they search online for information about the curse?\n\nIn the end, _It Follows_ offers little genuine horror, and the manufactured sense of dread wears thin well before the finale. Nor does it offer anything in the way of vicarious thrills. Its attempt to subvert slasher tropes only reinforces their value. Without them, there's nothing to distract us from what\u2019s otherwise a trite premise.\n\n[^1]: In a nice bit of foreshadowing, the movie playing is _Charade (1963)_.\n\n[^2]: It\u2019s a stupid plan. They place various plugged-in electrical items around the pool\u2019s edge. When the thing gets in the water, Jay will somehow get out and they\u2019ll fry it. Putting aside the logic of electrocuting a semi-invisible monster, wouldn't the pool have GFCI wiring?", "slug": "it-follows-2014"}, {"file_path": "reviews/wolfcop-2014.md", "sequence": 38, "imdb_id": "tt2781516", "title": "WolfCop", "year": 2014, "date": "2015-04-18", "grade": "B", "review_content": "\n_WolfCop_ is about an alcoholic sheriff\u2019s deputy who becomes a werewolf and uses his newfound powers to clean up his small town.

The manic energy is gone, along with any sense of pride from the people involved. Instead, we get half-assed camp with D-list performers that can\u2019t disguise their contempt for the material.\n\nTo that end, _WolfCop_ is a rarity. A lurid pulp creation made by talented folks who seem to be enjoying themselves. You can feel it in every over-the-top minute.\n\nConsider the transformation scene. A genre staple. Our protagonist, Lou, stumbles drunk into a dive bar bathroom. The change begins as he relieves himself. Lou lets out a howl. His urine turns blood red as his penis sprouts hair and inflates like a trick balloon.\n\nIt\u2019s a crazy shot, but not gratuitous. In leading with the genitals, WolfCop conveys the character\u2019s transformation pain better than any werewolf film I can recall. I laughed and cringed in the same breath.\n\nNot every scene is as calculated. Scenes like WolfCop tricking out his police cruiser, or foiling a gang of graffiti artists by hosing them down with his urine, are just silly. But that\u2019s okay.

The locals have gathered to burn Elizabeth Selwyn for the crime of witchcraft.[^1] As the flames consume her, Elizabeth pledges her soul to Lucifer in exchange for eternal life. The bloodthirsty villagers drown her out, chanting \u201cBurn witch, burn!\u201d\n\nSmash-cut to an extreme close-up of Christopher Lee repeating the same line. It's present day. Lee plays Alan Driscoll, a college professor lecturing a group of young students on the history of witchcraft. In attendance are our heroine, Nan, and her boyfriend Bill. Nan sits in rapt attention, shushing Bill's snide comments. It's clear Bill took the course just to hit on Nan. It's less clear what she sees in him.[^2]\n\nAfter the lecture, Nan approaches Professor Driscoll. Nan wants to use her upcoming winter break to write a thesis on witchcraft in New England, but feels she needs some first-hand research. She plans to get a room in the smallest, oldest town in New England she can find. There she\u2019ll comb through the town hall records, recheck the libraries, and interview the puritan descendants. Impressed by her enthusiasm, Driscoll suggests she visit his hometown, a small New England village called Whitewood. Nan agrees.\n\nBill, who\u2019d hoped Nan would spend the break with him, tries to dissuade her, but Nan remains resolute.\n\nBefore long, Nan\u2019s pulling up to a desolate filling station in the dead of night asking for directions to Whitewood. The station attendant tries to warn her away, but Nan dismisses his concern. Armed with directions, she heads out into the fog-covered night.\n\nOutside of town, Nan picks up a hitchhiker, played by Valentine Dyall. Dyall\u2019s performance is all ominous menace. When he speaks, it\u2019s as though someone is talking _through_ him.\n\nWhen Nan finally arrives in Whitewood, we recognize it from the opening sequence. The town drips atmosphere, from the fog-laced streets to the dark, claustrophobic interiors. Nan turns to her passenger who, of course, has vanished.\n\nNan checks into the local inn. The proprietor bears an uncanny resemblance to Elizabeth Selwyn.\n\nCan you see where this is going?\n\nBefore I venture any further, let me say that the DVD from VCI is under $10 on Amazon. It\u2019s the only way to watch the film. There's a print streaming on Amazon Prime and I\u2019ve seen a few others floating around on YouTube, but they\u2019re all cropped, scratchy or low resolution. Spend the $9 and change and watch it on a decent up-converting DVD player. It\u2019s worth it.\n\nBack to the review. At this point, those weary of spoilers should stop reading as I must cover a few plot points to illustrate why the film is so good.\n\nYou see, despite setting up a predictable plot where Nan gets captured by Elizabeth and rescued by her boyfriend, the film takes a darker turn. The witches of Whitewood lure Nan into the tunnels beneath the inn. They snatch her and drag her screaming into a hidden chamber. They place her on a sacrificial altar, holding her down as she kicks and thrashes. A black robed figure raises a knife over her chest. Nan screams. The knife drives toward her chest as we smash-cut to a knife plunging into a cake.\n\nNan is dead.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a narrative surprise, considering she\u2019d been our lone protagonist. Now it\u2019s Nan\u2019s brother, Bob, and Bill who retrace her steps and confront the evil lurking in the village.\n\nAnd remember Professor Driscoll? It\u2019s hinted early that he might be up to no good, but after Nan meets her fate, there\u2019s no doubt left. Driscoll is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, searching for victims to sustain his cursed brethren. Lee plays him with a perfect mix of cultured charm and seething menace.\n\nIndeed, Lee's performance, like the film, is an overlooked gem. While critics laud Lee's early work for Hammer productions, this entry by Hammer rival Amicus[^3] remains forgotten. It\u2019s a shame, especially considering this film\u2019s combination of contemporary setting and satanic themes foreshadowed the cinematic horror trends that proved to be Hammer\u2019s undoing.[^4]\n\nTo that end, one could say _The City of the Dead_ was ahead of its time.

John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate soldier turned drifter who visits his brother\u2019s family on the Texas frontier.\n\nShortly after Ethan arrives, Comanches massacre his brother and sister-in-law. After the funeral, Ethan sets off in search of his young niece Debbie, whom the Comanche have taken captive. Accompanying Ethan is Martin Pawley, an orphan Ethan\u2019s brother and sister-in-law raised as their own.\n\nIt\u2019s a daunting task. Director John Ford uses the gigantic mesas of Monument Valley to frame his characters as tiny and alone. Small specs on the vast, unforgiving landscape of the frontier.\n\nAs the years pass, Ethan\u2019s hatred for the Comanche consumes him. Martin realizes with growing horror that Ethan means to kill Debbie should they find her. Such is Ethan\u2019s unbridled hate for the Comanche, that he can\u2019t bear the thought of her having gone native.\n\nThe film isn\u2019t all dark. During breaks when the trail goes cold, Ethan and Martin return to a neighboring homestead. There, Martin and a young pioneer girl fumble at flirtation in a series of slapstick events. These bits can be jarring, but they exist to lighten the mood. Without them, the ending would feel disingenuous.\n\nPutting aside these comedic interludes, this is Wayne\u2019s movie. He gives a fearless performance. Consider the scene where he meets Martin. While he\u2019s all smiles around his family, when he sees Martin he goes cold. Martin is one-eighth Comanche. In a glance, Ethan identifies him as \u2018the other\u2019 and his bitterness bubbles to the surface. In Ethan, Wayne inhabits a disenfranchised, angry man. After battling on the losing side of a war, he longs for validation. In the Comanche he finds an outlet for his rage. Another war to fight. A chance to redeem himself.\n\nBut of course, he\u2019s beyond redemption. The now-famous closing shot illustrates this perfectly. As everyone enters the house, Ethan remains outside. He shifts his weight, watching the joy inside. In his eyes, we see a longing battling the unease. He turns and walks back toward the frontier alone.\n\nIt\u2019s this refusal to judge or redeem Wayne\u2019s character that makes _The Searchers_ resonate. Ethan has moments of compassion and heroism, but the film doesn\u2019t allow for a contrived finale that sees him cured of his bigotry. Nor does it paint him as a one-dimensional villain incapable of recognizing his own shortcomings. Instead, we\u2019re left to acknowledge Ethan\u2019s nature and contemplate the role men like him played in the settling of the American West.", "slug": "the-searchers-1956"}, {"file_path": "reviews/inside-out-2015.md", "sequence": 41, "imdb_id": "tt2096673", "title": "Inside Out", "year": 2015, "date": "2015-07-11", "grade": "C", "review_content": "\n_Inside Out_ is an ambitious animated feature that opens inside the mind of a newborn girl named Riley. There, we meet our protagonist Joy, an anthropomorphic emotion. In voicing Joy, Amy Poehler manages the near-impossible feat of being relentlessly optimistic and perky without ever being annoying.\n\nSoon, Riley\u2019s other core emotions\u2014Disgust, Fear, Anger and Sadness\u2014appear. The group operates out of Headquarters, a Space Needle shaped building at the center of Riley\u2019s consciousness. Using a pastel-infused command-console that looks equal parts Playskool and Apple, they influence Riley\u2019s behavior.\n\nEarly on, Joy dominates. Disgust, Fear, and Anger provide comic relief. Riley grows from infant to toddler to pre-teen. Outside Headquarters, islands akin to giant amusement parks spring to life. These represent Riley\u2019s personality. They grow as new happy memories are formed.\n\nIt\u2019s an efficient opening act with one misstep. Sadness is frustrating. Her actions feel plot-driven and, compared to Joy, her character arc is shallow.\n\nThe plot kicks in when Riley, now age 11, finds herself uprooted by a move to San Fransisco. At first, Joy coaxes Riley to remain positive. But a dilapidated house, frazzled parents, a new school, and a moving van that seems to circumnavigate the globe en-route to San Francisco, take their toll.\n\nThings get even worse when Joy and Sadness find themselves stranded far from Headquarters. This renders Riley unable to feel either of their respective emotions.\n\nNow, the film shifts to adventure as Joy struggles to get them back to Headquarters. On the way, the pair wander through Riley\u2019s long-term memories and meet her almost-forgotten imaginary friend, Bing Bong.\n\nMeanwhile, Riley, unable to feel anything but anger, fear and disgust, begins lashing out at her parents and friends. As she does, the islands of her personality crumble and fall away into nothingness.\n\nAs Joy\u2019s desperation to reach Headquarters grows, she and Sadness induce a nightmare involving a giant clown. It\u2019s a sequence that will give a fair number of viewers nightmares of their own.\n\nSoon after, the film offers a scene of unexpected depth. Joy and Bing Bong find themselves in a desolate dumping-ground where memories dissolve into dust. We see images of young Riley laughing and playing with Bing Bong. As these memories dissolve and blow away, Bing Bong himself fades from existence. He accepts his fate with a quiet dignity that belies his goofy exterior. It\u2019s a poignant moment that forces older viewers to acknowledge the loss of innocence inherit in growing up[^1].\n\nIt\u2019s this willingness to tackle complex themes without patronizing the audience that makes _Inside Out_ an impressive film. Odds are, you\u2019ll think it a wonderful movie. I did.\n\nWell, almost.\n\nTo explain my objection, I must discuss the ending. Spoiler alert.\n\nStill here? Okay.\n\nThe film climaxes with Riley, finally able to feel her emotions, crying and hugging her parents. As she does, the missing islands of her personality spring back into existence. Cut to a short time later. Riley is back to her old self.\n\nFor a film that felt so honest in its depiction of the human condition, this felt disingenuous. For all the drama of the islands of personality crumbling into the void, a simple hug reconstructs them exactly as they were?\n\nWhere are the consequences?\n\nThis was a chance to show Riley adjusting to the move, but at a cost. Maybe part of her never comes back. Maybe the relationship with her parents is forever altered. Maybe when that island returns it\u2019s different, maybe smaller. Anything but the saccharine, everything\u2019s okay bit of fluff we\u2019re given. Sure, new memories are now mixes of emotions instead of pure joy, but this is peddled as a wholly positive change. Where\u2019s the trade-off?\n\n_Inside Out_ drives home the message that growing up means accepting sadness as a part of life, yet it can\u2019t apply that lesson to its own ending.\n\n[^1]: Saddest Disney scene I can remember.

It\u2019s 1944 and the group has seen its share of action on the European lines. Now, they\u2019re enjoying a break in a bombed-out village near the Siegfried Line.\n\nPrivate John Reese, played by Steve McQueen, arrives with orders to join the squad. Reese, a former master sergeant demoted to private for insubordination, wastes little time alienating himself from the rest of the men. Rumors swirl that the squad\u2019s next orders will send them home. The men are giddy. Reese is forlorn. The war has become his life. Later that night, he disobeys orders and heads into town for a drink.\n\nBut, of course, the squad doesn\u2019t go home. Orders come through sending them back to the line. Reese brightens. On the line, he\u2019s calm but vigilant. An exemplary soldier. Good thing, because the existing American forces soon withdraw, leaving the squad horribly outnumbered. The men rig up a series of schemes to project an illusion of strength, but the Germans soon discover the truth.\n\nKnowing the undermanned squad can\u2019t withstand the inevitable German assult, Reese pushes for an attack on a German pillbox across the line. This would force the Germans into a defensive position, giving the squad a fighting chance. Reese gets orders to stay put while the acting officer leaves to notify command. Reese disregards these orders and convinces two other squad members to join him in a stealth raid. Acting without orders, the men make their way across the mine-leaden no-man\u2019s land with disastrous results.\n\nGiven its troubled production, the film should have been a disaster. Robert Pirosh wrote the script and planned to produce and direct. Once McQueen came aboard, the two clashed over script changes. McQueen wanted the other men\u2019s roles diminished and his beefed up. McQueen got his way and Pirosh walked. The studio installed Don Siegel as director. McQueen\u2019s antics had already alienated him from most of the cast, and he clashed with Siegel and the studio as production went on.\n\nAnd yet, the film works. Unlike the heroic melodrama typical of the genre, _Hell Is for Heroes_ features a dark, nihilistic undercurrent. During one of the film\u2019s most powerful scenes, a soldier screams \u201cMY GUTS!\u201d while clutching his stomach after getting shot. The performance is gripping. The screams go on. Pain gives way to panic. Mania creeps into the soldier\u2019s voice. It would be painful to watch if there were actual blood. But instead we\u2019re given bloodless wounds and carnage-free explosions.\n\nTo this end, _Hell Is for Heroes_ looks like a B-movie. The sweltering northern California woods can only suggest the muddy forests of Germany. During firefights, men stiffen up and fall over to simulate getting shot. Before the climatic battle, we\u2019re shown low-quality stock footage of artillery firing.\n\nBut McQueen\u2019s performance transcends the shoddy production. He doesn\u2019t say much. Instead, he uses his eyes and body language to show us Reese\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s a riveting turn that\u2019s equal parts cold detachment and tumultuous emotion. Watching the film, one is hard pressed to disagree with McQueen\u2019s insistence that the script focus on him. He carries the film.\n\nThe only performer who comes close to matching McQueen is James Coburn. Coburn plays Henshaw, a habitual tinkerer struggling with the destruction inherit in war. His defining scene sees him manning a flame-thrower, fighting back manic laughter as he incinerates a group of trapped German soldiers. It\u2019s a haunting visage that foreshadows the star Coburn would later become.\n\nGranted, not all the performances are winners. Nick Adams overplays his part as a Polish refugee. His scenes bleed into melodrama. And Bob Newhart looks lost doing a variation of his standup shtick. But the film overcomes these stumbles to finish strong.\n\nAccording to multiple accounts, the finale was an accident. The production simply ran out of money and couldn\u2019t shoot any more footage. Yet, it\u2019s the perfect, morally ambiguous, ending to punctuate the film\u2019s madness-of-war message. The men charge forward as the camera zooms in. The war goes on, even as the film comes to an end.

Not the bustling metropolis of today, but the seedy, dangerous cesspool Hollywood liked to conjure during the 70s and 80s. A vicious jungle where street punks, pimps, and pushers lurked around every darkened corner. The film embraces this atmosphere. Everything feels worn, lived-in, and used.\n\nThe story concerns a series of killings perpetrated by a uniformed police officer. The victims aren\u2019t criminals, but random innocent people. The killer frames young beat cop Jack Forrest (Bruce Campbell) for the murders. Grizzled detective Frank McCrae (Tom Atkins) doesn\u2019t buy it.\n\nAlong with Jack\u2019s cop girlfriend, McCrae tracks the killings to former cop Matt Cordell. Cordell was a legend on the force.  A super-cop whose shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later mentality landed him on the wrong side of the law. The only trouble? Cordell died in prison.\n\nOr did he? There\u2019s no explicit supernatural element, but Cordell\u2019s resilience is superhuman. Think Michael Myers from the _Halloween_ franchise. Though one wonders about the scars lacing his face. He recovers from a prison assault that saw him stabbed to a bloody pulp, but a few slashes to the face are a bridge too far? Does his body draw the line at cosmetic wounds?\n\nJack soon realizes Cordell is out to kill the mayor and police commissioner. The film feints staging this during the city\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade spectacle, but betrays its budget by engineering a car chase to an abandoned warehouse.\n\nAt least it\u2019s an entertaining car chase. The POV shots are reminiscent of Campbell\u2019s friend, director Sam Raimi, who turns up as a newsman introducing the parade.\n\nDespite its meager budget, _Maniac Cop_ is a lot of fun. Perhaps it\u2019s the cast. Campbell never takes himself too seriously, always acting as if he were impersonating a B-movie actor. And Atkins has made a career out of playing the same grizzled, hard-drinking cop. He delivers a conscious, but not condescending, stereotype. Just because the performance is familiar, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s any less welcome. Atkins plays McCrae with the perfect amount of gravitas.  His reaction during the scene where Richard Roundtree, as the police commissioner, tells him \u201cYou don\u2019t smile very much,\u201d made me laugh out loud.\n\nAlong those lines, director William Lustig injects a streak of black comedy. Consider the scene where Cordell asphyxiates a man in a block of wet concrete. Lustig smash cuts to the following morning as jackhammers work to extract the face-down corpse.\n\nThat said, _Maniac Cop_ is not perfect. Cordell\u2019s big reveal is something of a letdown. Robert Z\u2019Dar is fine, but I couldn\u2019t help thinking of Brian Thompson. The bigger problem is Jack\u2019s girlfriend. Despite being a vice cop, she acts like a teenage girl, shrieking at every development. Not what you\u2019d expect from a trained officer familiar with life-threatening situations. I don\u2019t fault actress Laurene Landon. She\u2019s convincing in some scenes and ridiculous in others. This falls on Lustig.\n\nStill, _Maniac Cop_ is that rarest of B-movies, one made by folks who seem to enjoy the work. Like most horror films of that era, _Maniac Cop_ got a sequel.

It was a good plan, considering the squad of undead, water-breathing Nazi storm troopers lurking outside. Then one survivor gets claustrophobic and fires a signal flare into the refrigerator. That\u2019s where _Shock Waves_ lost me.\n\nThe film had potential. Early on, John Carradine captains a small sight-seeing boat. On board are his mate, the chef, and four tourists. Carradine holds our interest while the script forces a series of contrived events to strand the boat on a remote island. The most ridiculous of which sees him throw the ship\u2019s navigation system overboard.\n\nAt least the island locations look great. The characters trudge through overgrown marshes and watery bogs to discover a crumbling hotel. The filmmakers struck gold here, shooting in an abandoned Biltmore. Its decrepit luxury oozes atmosphere.\n\nBut the script\u2019s inanity is taxing. Moving through the hotel, the group discovers an aquarium teaming with exotic fish. Yet, moments later, they seem surprised to find the hotel occupied.\n\nPeter Cushing plays the hotel\u2019s lone resident, a morose Nazi living in self-imposed exile. He warns the group to leave the island, even telling them where they can find a boat. Do they listen? Of course not.\n\nBoth Cushing and Carradine have roles so minor they\u2019re window dressing, but they\u2019re the best parts of the film.\n\nSoon, undead Nazis are picking off the stranded visitors. They get a lot of help from the script. A veteran sailor impales his foot on a sea urchin after tromping barefoot through a murky inland stream. Later, five grown men and women lose a sailboat, their only chance at escape, in knee-deep water. After that, the group scatters and one man decides to flee alone down a waist-deep stream.\n\nThe Nazis themselves are a nameless, nondescript unit of waterlogged storm troopers. We see them rising from the ocean depths, their expressionless faces clad with black goggles. It\u2019s a memorable visual. In part because the film repeats it over and over. Nazis walk into the water. Nazis walk out of the water. Nazis sit up in shallow bogs of water like vampires rising from a coffin.\n\nWhich brings us back to where _Shock Waves_ lost me. The four survivors are safe, locked in the hotel\u2019s vault-like fridge. One becomes claustrophobic. He demands to leave. Knowing certain death lurks outside, the others say no. The claustrophobic man becomes enraged. He fires a flare gun into the fridge then flees into the zombie-infested night. The signal flare fills the fridge with smoke and blinds a woman. Rather than allow the smoke to clear, the two other survivors also flee, abandoning the blinded one.\n\nThe characters in _Shock Waves_ are so inane, by the end, we\u2019re rooting against them. We can\u2019t connect with them because they don\u2019t behave like human beings. They act like idiots.\n\nThis alone isn\u2019t a bad thing. One vicarious thrill of horror movies lies in seeing such foolish behavior punished.\n\nBut _Shock Waves_ disappoints. When claustrophobia guy jeopardizes the lives of everyone with his selfish behavior, we expect to see him offed in spectacular fashion. But his demise consists of a zombie pulling him underwater.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame. Even on an exploitation level, the film doesn\u2019t deliver.

Or at least watch the second half first.\n\nThe film comprises two hour-long segments based on the works of Edgar Allen Poe. The first, directed by George Romero, adapts _The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar_. The second, directed by Dario Argento, loosely adapts _The Black Cat_.\n\n_The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar_ stars Adrienne Barbeau as Jessica, a woman embezzling her elderly husband\u2019s fortune. Her former lover, Dr. Hoffman, hypnotizes the ailing Ernest Valdemar under the guise of easing his pain. Hoffman then orders the hypnotized Valdemar to sign his assets over to Jessica, who liquidates them.\n\nAll goes according to plan until Valdemar dies while under hypnosis. Trapped in a hypnotic state, Valdemar\u2019s soul cannot cross over to the land of the dead.\n\nSoon, Valdemar\u2019s frozen corpse is stalking the two conspirators, shambling around calling Jessica\u2019s name. He does this without moving his mouth, which was a problem for me, but I\u2019ll get to that later.\n\nRomero\u2019s segment has a made-for-TV feel. I can\u2019t identify the exact cause. Perhaps it\u2019s the under-written characters, or the under-furnished sets. Or the flat lighting. Maybe it\u2019s the stiff performances. Or the EC Comics style twist ending. Whatever the reason, Romero\u2019s film could pass for a lost episode of _Tales From the Crypt_.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. I loved that show. But, fair or not, one expects more from a feature film.\n\nAstute viewers will notice a problem with Ramy Zada as Dr. Hoffman. The script tells us he and Jessica were lovers before she married Valdemar, back when she worked as a stewardess. But Zada\u2019s thirteen years younger than Barbeau. Assuming Barbeau was in her early twenties during their affair, that puts Zada at ten years old.\n\nBut I can get past that.\n\nWhat I couldn\u2019t get past was Valdemar\u2019s ventriloquist act. I couldn\u2019t buy hearing his voice without seeing his mouth move. Romero may have been trying to stay faithful to the source material, but the result feels like what it is: a dubbed-in effect. Worse, it feels unintentional. As though they added it as an afterthought, or because they couldn\u2019t get the prosthetics working right on-set.\n\nRomero\u2019s script has something to say about greed, but his segment lacks the focus and visceral punch of his better work. The story drags and the ending feels obligatory instead of shocking.\n\nArgento\u2019s entry, _The Black Cat_ stars Harvey Keitel as Rod (short for Roderick) Usher, a tabloid photographer. We meet him at a crime scene. A woman lies naked on a table, cleaved in half at the waist. Rod snaps pictures of the lurid spectacle while chatting with the detectives investigating the crime. Poking around, he releases a large pendulum blade. We get a dynamic POV shot as the blade arcs down with a roar and embeds itself between the corpse\u2019s halves.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Rod descends into madness culminating in murder. There are some supernatural elements, including the persistent titular feline, but they\u2019re presented as possible figments of Rod\u2019s imagination.\n\nArgento piles on the Poe references en route to a Grand Guignol conclusion that\u2019s so over-the-top it\u2019ll make you laugh and gag in the same breath.\n\nFinal reveal aside, the film balances atmosphere and gore. Rod\u2019s brownstone has a worn, lived-in feel. The narrow, shadow-filled rooms engender feelings of confinement. The city streets, feelings of isolation and anonymity. The gruesome murders Rod photographs are both inspired by Poe tales. Besides the halved corpse that opens the film, we see one with its mouth wired open after having its teeth pried out.\n\nArgento\u2019s only outright misstep is Keitel\u2019s wardrobe. Harvey\u2019s a great actor and a good choice, but he should never, ever, wear a beret.\n\nHow to rate the film? _Two Evil Eyes_ is uneven.

Unfortunately, the script, from Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s _Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde_, doesn\u2019t live up to its own hype.\n\nChristopher Lee, sporting an unwieldy hairpiece, plays Marlowe, a psychiatrist in early 20th century England exploring Freud\u2019s theories of the id, ego and super-ego. Marlowe invents a drug that removes the ego and super-ego, leaving only the primal id.\n\nWell, mostly. At first, the subjects turn primal. Violent, lusty, or terrified. But later, the titular character shows signs of an ego, formulating long term plans and deferring gratification. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re meant to notice this behavior.\n\nAnyway. After dosing his cat, and a few of his patients, Marlowe begins experimenting on himself. This brings forth the contemptible Mr. Blake. Marlowe\u2019s transformation is physical as well as mental. The more corrupt and immoral Blake becomes, the more hideous Blake\u2019s visage. It\u2019s not clear how this relates to Freud\u2019s theories.\n\nIn time, Marlow\u2019s friend and solicitor Mr. Utterson, played by Peter Cushing, comes to believe Blake is blackmailing Marlowe. Seeking to aid his friend, Utterson investigates Blake, and begins to suspect the unthinkable truth.\n\n_I, Monster_ disappoints given its two leads. Lee is magnetic during his transformation scenes, and repulsive yet captivating as Blake. Cushing\u2019s character is little more than a plot device, but he\u2019s still fun to watch. A Jekyll and Hyde story featuring these two shouldn\u2019t be so forgettable.\n\nWhere the film shines is in its art direction. Marlowe\u2019s laboratory has a cluttered, lived-in feel that lends atmosphere while avoiding the usual mad scientist tropes. His club sees cultured, well-dressed gentlemen sipping whiskey in overstuffed chairs while discussing professional and philosophical issues. I could almost smell the leather and tobacco.\n\nYet, the film doesn\u2019t work. Even at a scant 75 minutes, _I, Monster_ is too long. There\u2019s just not enough story to sustain a feature length film. Having Marlow inject the serum instead of gulping a potion is a nice touch, but the script doesn\u2019t run with the addiction metaphor.\n\nInstead, we see characters walking down hallways, walking across rooms, and going up and down stairs. Lots of extraneous shots that add nothing, but seem necessary to pad the running time. Perhaps these bits were part of the abandoned attempt to utilize the Pulfrich effect for 3-D.\n\nRegardless, one could drop fifteen minutes and have a solid film, but then it wouldn\u2019t be a feature. The studio, Amicus, is best known for their horror anthologies. Films like _Dr. Terror\u2019s House of Horrors (1965)_, _Torture Garden (1967)_, _The House That Dripped Blood (1971)_, _Tales from the Crypt (1972)_, _Asylum (1972)_, _Vault of Horror (1973)_ and _From Beyond the Grave (1974)_.

Given the film\u2019s obscurity, my expectations were low.\n\nThe story follows Bud, played by Eric Linden. Bud is a young man from Hoopersville, an Indiana town with a population of just eight thousand. Bud\u2019s inherited a small sum and can\u2019t wait to escape small-town life. He buys a train ticket for New York City. Convinced the big city will eat him alive, the station staff wager Bud will return within a month.\n\nUpon arriving, Bud checks into a posh suite at the expensive Hotel Hercules. This at the suggestion of Bud\u2019s only contact in New York, his cousin Gibboney.\n\nCousin Gibboney is a fast-talking piece of work. When Bud says he\u2019s paying eight dollars per day for his suite, Gibboney feigns nonchalance. \u201cWell don\u2019t worry about that,\u201d Gibboney says, \u201cI\u2019ll just have that chopped right in half. I\u2019ll speak to the manager of the hotel, he\u2019s an old pal of mine.\u201d Later, Gibboney explains, \u201cThat room was supposed to go for twelve dollars a day, but don\u2019t worry, I spoke to the manager and I fixed it. It\u2019s all right. You can have it for eight.\u201d\n\nGibboney introduces Bud to a couple of chorus girls, including Vida, played by Joan Blondell. Vida and Bud make googly eyes. Gibboney invites the girls to a party in Bud\u2019s suite later that evening.\n\nWith Bud\u2019s money, Gibboney acquires some black market booze. Assorted partiers arrive. Bud and Vida flirt, ignoring the crowd and the hooch. Credit the film for accuracy here, as the crowd goes from jubilant antics to a drunken stupor as the night wears on. As the guest begin to leave, there\u2019s a drunken fight between two men, one played by Bogart. The lights go out. When they come back on, one guest is dead. The remaining partygoers flee, including Vida.\n\nThe police figure Bud for the murder, and issue a warrant for his arrest. Alone and short on funds, Bud reunites with Vida in a speakeasy. He uses the last of his money to gamble, hoping to win enough to secure a future with Vida. Bud wins back his losses and then some, but of course, he doesn\u2019t quit while he\u2019s ahead. Bud loses everything. Then the police pounce.\n\nThe film plays as a cautionary fable, but the pre-code script imbues New York with a certain allure. Part of said allure is Blondell as Vida. She\u2019s all wholesome charm tinged with a bad-girl streak. Like a spiked milkshake. Before gambling away his money, Bud wonders if they should just leave. Vida replies, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna leave. I wanna stay where there\u2019s noise and excitement and crowds!\u201d Judging by Bud\u2019s reaction, this is just the response he wanted.\n\nLinden plays Bud as naive without being cloying. The script helps. In a lesser film, Bud would be judgmental. Here, he doesn\u2019t object to the bootleg gin and he knows his way around a dice game.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a great film, but it\u2019s not a bad one either. It held my interest and even offered a chuckle or two via Gibboney\u2019s rapid-fire dialog.

As with _The House That Dripped Blood (1971)_, the script comes courtesy of Robert Bloch.\n\nThe framing story follows a young doctor named Martin. Martin is interviewing for a position at an asylum for the \u201cincurable insane\u201d. He\u2019s greeted with several surprises. The asylum head, Dr. Starr, has gone insane himself and is now counted amongst the asylum\u2019s patients. Starr\u2019s replacement, Dr. Rutherford, is wheel-chair bound after a patient attack. As if those weren\u2019t enough red flags,  Rutherford makes Martin an unusual offer. Martin can have the job provided he deduces which of the patients is Dr. Starr. Martin protests, but heads upstairs to interview the patients. The bulk of the film illustrates their stories.\n\nThe first story concerns a man who murders his wife, chops up her body, wraps the parts in packing paper, and stores them in a basement freezer. Unfortunately, said wife had a magic bracelet. When the husband tosses the bracelet into the freezer, the body parts spring to life, attacking him and his mistress.\n\nThese types of stories always fail to suspend my disbelief. Not the resurrection part which is creepy with a nice touch where we see a severed head sucking air through the paper wrap. No, the problem lies in the physics of those body parts moving about. Just because they\u2019re reanimated, it doesn\u2019t give them the ability to fly. Yet, how else to explain a severed head climbing a flight of stairs? We see arms and legs lurching about and it looks laughable.\n\nNext we meet Bruno, a former tailor. Broke and facing eviction, Bruno finds salvation in a mysterious gentlemen named Smith. Played by Peter Cushing, Smith offers an extraordinary sum for Bruno to make a suit for Smith\u2019s son. Smith insists Bruno must work according to Smith\u2019s precise specifications. These include oddities such as only working on the suit during the late night and early morning hours. Bruno agrees to Smith\u2019s demands and, a few nights later, arrives on Smith\u2019s doorstep with the suit. To Bruno\u2019s horror, Smith reveals that he has no money to pay. This will prove to be Smith\u2019s smallest surprise.\n\nIn what will become a running theme, the special effects are the story\u2019s undoing. Cushing is great, and the story\u2019s mystery held my attention. But the finale relies on another effect I couldn\u2019t swallow.\n\nThe third entry is more grounded. The story concerns a young woman named Barbara, played by Charlotte Rampling. Barbara is fresh from psychiatric care and under the careful watch of her brother and a nurse. Soon, Barbara\u2019s mischievous friend Lucy shows up. Lucy urges Barbara not to take her medication. Not good for Barbara\u2019s brother and nurse.\n\nThis story is most effective of the lot, but the big reveal will be obvious to anyone with a passing knowledge of the horror genre.\n\nThe last tale involves Dr. Byron, played by Herbert Lom. Byron has perfected soul transference and transfers his essence into a small effigy. The figure resembles a robot as tall as a can of soda with a plastic Herbert Lom head. It looks as ridiculous as it sounds. The stop motion animation reminded me of the Rankin Bass Christmas specials. Despite its appearance, it\u2019s quite deadly, as Dr. Rutherford soon discovers.\n\nWhat to make of this final tale? I can\u2019t imagine anyone finding it frightening. Did director Roy Ward Baker give up and try for camp?\n\nAnd what of _Asylum_ as a whole? Given the talent involved, it\u2019s a let down. Instead of exploiting its able cast, _Asylum_\u2019s script relies on special effects the production can\u2019t deliver. The one time it _does_ lean on its cast, it forces poor Charlotte Rampling through a tired trope.

Not that different, I suppose, from what I expect of the films I review.\n\nBut just as I\u2019m willing to humor a movie that stumbles, provided its intentions are good, I ask you, dear reader, to bear with me.\n\n_The House that Dripped Blood_ comprises four stories revolving around an old English country house. They vary in quality.\n\nThe first story, _Method for Murder_, sees a writer, Charles Hillyer, move into the house along with his wife. Hillyer writes lurid thrillers. He\u2019s certain the house\u2019s creaky atmosphere will help him finish his latest novel. Things take a turn for the macabre when Hillyer sees his literary creation, the murderous strangler Dominic, lurking around the estate.\n\nIt\u2019s a worn premise, but screenwriter Robert Bloch puts a twist on the twist that makes for a satisfying ending.\n\nThe second story, _Waxworks_, follows a retired businessman named Philip Grayson, played by Peter Cushing. While touring a horrific wax museum in town, Grayson notices a figure that bears a striking resemblance to a girl he loved as a young man. Soon, he\u2019s obsessed with the perceived effigy and, as you suspect, it doesn\u2019t end well.\n\nAs with the first installment, you\u2019ll see the twist coming, but Cushing makes it work. Soon to be a widower in real life, Cushing brings a pathos to what\u2019s otherwise a throw-away role.\n\nThe third story, _Sweets to the Sweet_ is the best. Christopher Lee plays John Reid, a widower. The details surrounding his wife\u2019s death are hazy, and Reid doesn\u2019t seem to miss her. He moves into the house with his young daughter, Jane.\n\nUpon arrival the estate agent gives them a tour of the house. When they reach a room with a lit fireplace, Jane runs crying from the fire.\n\nReid hires a tutor for Jane, insisting she not go to school with other children. Astonished Jane has no toys of her own, the tutor buys her a small doll. Outraged, Reid throws the doll into the fire.\n\nThe mystery builds to a satisfying conclusion, with Lee exploiting audience expectations.\n\nThe final story, _The Cloak_, concerns an aging, egotistical horror actor named Paul Henderson. In a flat bit of meta-humor, he dismisses the current generation of horror films, saying he prefers the classics, like Dracula. Although he\u2019s quick to add \u201cThe Lugosi one, not this new chap.\u201d\n\nThe plot kicks in when Henderson acquires a cape that belonged to an actual vampire. Wearing it, Henderson sprouts fangs, loses his reflection, and gains the ability to fly.\n\nIt\u2019s played as camp, which is a shame. Co-star Ingrid Pitt, strikes the right balance, but Jon Pertwee\u2019s performance as Henderson never hooked me. The resulting segment fails to thrill or amuse.\n\nAnthology films are hard to grade. My rating averages the individual segments. The third piece\u2019s excellences cancels the fourth\u2019s failed camp.

The film follows Bulger\u2019s ascent from small-time hood to crime-lord of South Boston. A journey made possible by the FBI.\n\nEarly in the film, the Feds offer Bulger a sweet deal. In exchange for information on the Italian mob in North Boston, the FBI leave Bulger\u2019s crew alone. Even better, they eliminate the competition. Best of all, Bulger\u2019s FBI handler is a South Boston native who idolizes him.\n\nAll the FBI ask is that Bulger not kill anyone.\n\nBut of course, Bulger kills people. He executes one of his lackeys. His gang somehow gets involved in Jai Alai and Bulger orders the commissioner killed. He strangles a young girl who may have talked to the cops.\n\nThis last murder was where the film lost me. It\u2019s late in the film and the script introduces the girl only for Bulger to kill her five minutes later. The scene plays like something out of a horror movie and does nothing to build characterization or advance the plot.\n\nWe also meet Bulger\u2019s younger brother, a state senator played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch is good casting. His Boston accent may be jarring, but he\u2019s believable as Depp\u2019s brother. While both men seem too slight for their parts, they\u2019re convincing as family.\n\nThe film invites comparisons with Scorsese\u2019s _Goodfellas (1990)_ and _The Departed (2006)_, but these comparisons underscore _Black Mass_\u2019s weakness: Bulger isn\u2019t a compelling character.\n\nWe see Bulger build his empire, yet have no idea how he spends a typical day. He makes piles of money but, aside from a pair of cowboy boots, we never see him spend it. He suffers what we\u2019re told are life-changing tragedies, yet seems unfazed.\n\nDepp tries as Bulger, but he can\u2019t compensate for the shallow characterization. He can\u2019t disappear into the character because there is no character, just makeup and an accent.\n\nWith no psychological insight, _Black Mass_ feels hollow.

When he's ordered home, Bogart and Parker try to marry but a series of contrivances thwarts their efforts and Bogart leaves.\n\nCut to present day where more contrivances see a washed-up Bogart land a test pilot job for an aviation mogul played by Raymond Massey.

Bogart wants the money the stunt will net him so he can propose to Parker. Whorf wants time to finish his safety innovations.\n\nAs Bogart races to Washington clad in the aforementioned flight suit, Whorf races to implement his new designs, using himself as a test pilot.\n\nThere\u2019s a passable story buried in _Chain Lightning_, but Bogart\u2019s wrong for the role. The laughable sight of him squeezed into the flight suit distracts from the script\u2019s foresight. Though common enough today, escape pods, pressurized flight suits, and braking parachutes were science fiction to 1950s audiences.\n\nCompounding matters, the film pushes the melodrama, despite the three leads having no chemistry. Will Bogart and Parker get back together? Will there be obstacles to their romance?

Those expecting to sit back, tune out, and be entertained may find themselves frustrated.\n\nBut Eggers rewards our attention. The film\u2019s credibility astounds. The production built a working farm and lit it with near-natural light sources. Eggers scoured Canada for a forest that could pass for New England woodland.

The voice isn't Wayne's, and it's clear he won't win any lip-sync awards. After his introduction, Wayne evades some bad guys in a scene that tries for slapstick but fails. Soon, he\u2019s embroiled in a water-rights dispute between some ranchers and a shady businessman. Suffering from laughable dialog and stilted pacing, the film works best when it cuts to the action.\n\nOverseen by Yakima Canutt, the stunts pack a raw, visceral energy. One, a horse and rider diving off a cliff into a lake, proved so impressive, the studio recycled it for later productions.\n\nThis was John Wayne's first film for Monogram Pictures. Over the next two years, Monogram would cast Wayne as the lead in 16 productions, all westerns. They were quick and cheap shoots, wrapping in a week with budgets of around ten-thousand dollars.\n\nWith these films, Wayne began crafting his on-screen image. During production, he bonded with the stuntmen over drinks and card games. Many were real cowboys. Wayne\u2019s desire to emulate their physicality and mannerisms formed the foundation of his iconic posture, gait, and cadence.\n\nI wouldn't recommend _Riders of Destiny_, but for John Wayne fans it's an opportunity to watch the fledgling actor workshop a persona that would become legend.", "slug": "riders-of-destiny-1933"}, {"file_path": "reviews/mars-attacks-1996.md", "sequence": 61, "imdb_id": "tt0116996", "title": "Mars Attacks!", "year": 1996, "date": "2016-10-10", "grade": "C-", "review_content": "\n_Mars Attacks!_ could have been awful but settles for mediocre.\n\nThe film jumps between several storylines as aliens from Mars attack Earth. We follow the President and his staff, a pair of television personalities, a family in rural Kansas, a sleazy Las Vegas developer, and a washed up heavyweight boxer. Jack Nicholson leads an all-star cast as both the President and the Vegas developer.\n\nThe studio advertised the film as spoofing 1950s science-fiction pictures, but it doesn\u2019t play that way. Among the cast, it's telling that amateur actor and former NFL fullback Jim Brown seems the most comfortable. He plays the boxer reduced to dressing as a pharaoh for an Egyptian-themed casino. When the Martians attack, Brown heads out to reunite with his ex-wife (Pam Grier) and kids. He gets some help from Tom Jones, who plays himself. There\u2019s a wonderful scene where Brown asks Jones, \u201cDo you know how to fly a plane?\u201d to which Jones replies, \u201cOf course! You got one?\u201d\n\nThis sort of goofball casting matches the goofy sci-fi premise.  Brown and Jones both seem aware of their shortcomings as actors, and their stiff performances are genuine and entertaining.\n\nIt\u2019s a glimpse of the movie I suspect director Tim Burton wanted to make. He seems less interested in spoofing the genre than recreating it.\n\nThat\u2019s not a bad idea, but no one told the big-name cast. Few appear to enjoy the material. Most convey a sense of condescension, their performances screaming \u201cI\u2019m overacting on purpose!\u201d.\n\nDid they have a choice? Unlike Brown and Jones, the rest of the cast can\u2019t pretend they\u2019re amateurs. And playing it straight wouldn\u2019t have helped. Pam Grier plays her role with such conviction, her scenes feel spliced in from a different film. Martin Short plays his role as though he were in an overt comedy, to similar effect.\n\nAt least they got the Martians right. The 1950s films featured serious monsters cobbled together with silly effects. Here, we get cartoonish villains brought to life with no visible wires, seams, or zippers. In my favorite scene, the Martians laser a national monument, catch the falling debris with their flying saucer, and redirect the rubble onto a fleeing tour group.\n\nStill, _Mars Attacks!_ underwhelms.

Now, he follows his older brother everywhere. In the process, he uncovers some strange goings-on involving the local mortician, played by Angus Scrimm.\n\nI love how writer-director Don Coscarelli avoids traditional plot tropes. When no one believes him, the kid breaks into the mortuary. After evading a lethal flying ball, he escapes with a gruesome piece of evidence. The next morning, he shows his older brother, who takes a single look and says, \u201cOkay, I believe you.\u201d A lesser film would see the boy lose the evidence during his escape, or have the older brother dismiss it with some awkward rationalization.\n\nI won\u2019t reveal any more of the plot, as much of the film's joy comes from the unexpected directions it takes. It plays like a surreal nightmare. Scenes feel disjointed. We often sense we\u2019re missing something. These seeming plot holes only add to the film\u2019s unrelenting sense of unease.\n\nThough it\u2019s often lumped in with the slasher pictures that dominated early 80s horror, _Phantasm_ stands apart. It\u2019s equal parts science fiction and dark fantasy. Take out the brief nudity and iconic chrome ball, and you'd have a PG-13 film.\n\nBut about that ball. Those with squeamish stomachs may find it rough. As a special effect, it\u2019s a collision of imagination,  exploitation, and blood. Lots of blood.\n\nThat ball pushed my younger self over the edge. I had nightmares for weeks. So much of the film, from the stark white mortuary interiors to Scrimm himself, looks unsettling. It sounds unsettling too, with an ominous, disconcerting score that adds to the film's impact.\n\nWatching it now, _Phantasm_ plays like a remake of the film I saw as a child.

He\u2019s noticed girls and nudie-books, but still clings to his teddy bear. When his parents take a trip, Jamie develops a crush on the live-in babysitter.\n\nIt\u2019s a reasonable set-up for a coming-of-age comedy, but the script takes a different direction. Jamie\u2019s teddy bear urges him to do things. Bad things, like watch his babysitter while she sleeps, or terrorize a neighbor into stripping nude as he snaps Polaroids, or frame a man for murder, or feed people to a pit of trolls.\n\nThe way the movie lumps the titular pit in with Jamie\u2019s other deviations is part of its quirky charm. The troll effects look cheap, and the entire premise of luring people into a giant hole in the woods is silly. It\u2019s as though the filmmakers knew they couldn\u2019t make these bits scary, so they opted for weird. It works. Instead of a forgettable monster movie we get oddball schlock. And I love how obnoxious the film paints Jamie\u2019s victims. Early on, Jamie, looking lonesome, approaches an older boy and girl. Jamie says little more than \u201cHi,\u201d before the older boy punches him in the face. No reason, the boy\u2019s just mean. When Jamie feeds him to the trolls, we\u2019re not sad.\n\nBut there\u2019s another movie lurking beneath the inanity. A much darker one. Bits and pieces surface, like Jamie alluding to his mother molesting him, or the aforementioned scene where he watches his babysitter sleep. These scenes transcend the schlock and convey a genuine sense of unease.\n\nTo that end, _The Pit_ is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s not a good film, but its off-beat nature intrigues. You laugh as Jamie wheels an old biddy into the pit, then feel your skin crawl as he hits on his babysitter.

A masked killer strangles two female university students, sparking a manhunt. Another student thinks she recognizes the murder weapon, leading to threatening phone calls from the killer. Alarmed, she retreats to a cliff-side villa with four girlfriends, including an American exchange student, played by Suzy Kendall. The killer, of course, follows.\n\nIt plays as a mystery, inviting us to guess the killer\u2019s identity. The script proffers a myriad of suspects, painting almost every male character as possessive, misogynistic, or perverted. The few that appear normal feel suspect by comparison. I admit, it fooled me.\n\nMystery aside, what I enjoyed most about _Torso_ was its style. There\u2019s a scene where the killer tracks a girl through a swampy marsh. The lighting, camerawork, and editing create a kind of kinetic claustrophobia. The more she runs, the more her world shrinks. Even as the tension held me rapt, the sheer craft made me smile.\n\nAnd it gets better. The last act sees Kendall locked in a bedroom. She slides a piece of newspaper under the door, hoping to catch the key as she forces it out of the lock. I won't spoil what happens, but I will say this scene caps twenty-some dialog-free minutes that serve as a master class in suspense. They're so good, I forgave the finale, which sees the killer reveal his identity and explain his psychosis via some awkward and disappointing exposition.\n\nMy only problem with _Torso_ lies with its heroines. I liked how the film paints them as strong, independent women. Fleeing to a remote outpost wasn't the smartest move, but it was refreshing to see them do something besides run to the nearest man for protection. If only the script had provided them with distinct personalities. Aside from Kendall\u2019s character, they felt interchangeable and never endeared themselves.

He's there to expose self-professed black magician Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis) as a fraud. Karswell tries to dissuade Holden, but Holden remains resolute. Karswell then announces Holden will die in three days. Holden is skeptical, but after a series of unexplained events, his skepticism crumbles and he begins to fear for his life.\n\nThis is the best kind of thriller: one populated by intelligent characters who behave according to their personalities, not the whims of the plot. It avoids cheap jump-scares. Instead, director Jacques Tourneur uses atmosphere to build tension. Shadowy hallways and darkened rooms keep us on edge. And, for the real horror, there's Niall MacGinnis.\n\nI loved MacGinnis' performance. It's a perfect combination of charm and menace. There's a great scene where Holden has broken into Karswell's palatial home. In the darkness, a house cat transforms into a leopard and attacks. Holden struggles for his life, only escaping once Karswell enters and turns on the lights. Karswell treats the intruding Holden as one would treat a party guest who'd gotten lost looking for the bathroom. By underplaying the role, MacGinnis makes the character all the more sinister. Christopher Lee built a career on similar performances. And yet, MacGinnis conveys a vulnerability beneath the bluster that adds unexpected depth.\n\nOpposite MacGinnis, Andrews delivers a curious turn. His cadence and speech patterns mimic John Wayne's. They're so similar, I wonder if it was a deliberate impersonation. This brings up an interesting tangent. The Duke played many roles in many movies, but he never made a straight horror picture. Judging by Andrews' performance here, Wayne could have pulled it off with flair.\n\nYet, despite the solid script, competent direction and inspired performances, _Curse of the Demon_ falters. The opening sequence sees the titular demon marching out of the woods. A similar sequence occurs at the film's end. In both, the demon\u2019s mechanical movement and frozen expression scream rubber suit. My wife thought it resembled a homecoming float. Not only do these shots cheapen the film, they undermine any sense of ambiguity regarding Karswell's powers. Holden is the audience surrogate. His skepticism is our skepticism. But this falls apart when we know Karswell's powers are real from the outset. Instead of questioning things along with Holden, we grow impatient waiting for him to catch up. A great psychological thriller devolves into a cheap monster movie.\n\nWe can thank producer Hal E. Chester. He added the demon shots after principal photography wrapped. Tourneur and Andrews fought him on it. Writer Charles Bennett threatened to shoot Chester dead. They all lost.

But unlike that film, which was about women's reproductive rights, _The Sentinel_ isn't about anything. It's an exploitation picture offering a smorgasbord of gore, nudity, lesbianism, human deformities, and female masturbation. I don't mind these things. I object to the film\u2019s middling execution.\n\nMovie fans will enjoy spotting the once and future stars peppering the cast. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer as an unnamed robed figure. Ava Gardner as a charming real estate agent. Burgess Meredith as a creepy neighbor. Eli Wallach as a cagey detective. Christopher Walken as Wallach\u2019s grinning partner. Jeff Goldblum as a fashion photographer. Beverly D\u2019Angelo as a mute exhibitionist. An unrecognizable John Carradine as an aging priest.\n\nBut the film wastes its talented ensemble. It regulates most of the former stars, like Ferrer, Gardner, and Carradine, to throwaway roles for name recognition. Other performances veer into camp. Beverly D\u2019Angelo\u2019s memorable scene elicits chuckles instead of chills. Eli Wallach's phoned-in turn plays as caricature.\n\nThe sprawling cast is a byproduct of the convoluted, nonsensical plot. Consider the scene where a character breaks through a wall in the brownstone and uncovers a plaque bearing an inscription from Dante\u2019s _Inferno_. It\u2019s the film in a microcosm: effective and atmospheric, but its logic crumbles under the slightest scrutiny.\n\nWhat saved the film for me was Sarandon. Despite sporting a mustache that only adds to the film's second-rate feel, Sarandon is perfect in his role. He avoids the idiot plot and acts according to character.

An acolyte approaches a great master for training, excels against the odds, then clashes with the master\u2019s once favorite student. This film merely substitutes magic for kung-fu.\n\nThe problem lies in the homogenized and watered-down execution. Strange\u2019s arc revolves around him overcoming his arrogance. But the film paints him as a brilliant surgeon far ahead of his colleagues. Is that arrogance? Why not paint Strange as a real monster? The film doesn\u2019t seem comfortable making Strange too unlikable. Thus, Cumberbatch\u2019s Strange plays as a less fun version of Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s Tony Stark from the _Iron Man_ films. The resulting character feels thin and flat.\n\nThis extends to the villains. Mads Mikkelsen can play a great bad guy but fails to register as Kaecilius. The script gives him no edge. We\u2019ve seen the disgruntled student archetype in countless films before, and _Doctor Strange_ offers nothing new. Even Dormammu, who should rank among the most horrific villains in the Marvel oeuvre, fails to terrify.\n\nThe special effects also fail to connect. We see cities twisting and folding upon themselves like Rubik\u2019s Cubes, but the film fails to surround these scenes with a compelling story. Watching New York transform into an M.C. Escher style visage is impressive, but not engaging. The effects should serve the story, not substitute for it.\n\nThis sounds like I hated the film. I did not.

A young couple moves to a small, isolated village where they hope to renovate an old house. They ignore repeated warnings to leave and bad things happen, culminating in the young lovers barricading themselves in their home, fighting to keep an unspeakable evil from gaining entry.\n\nThe difference is in the details. _Straw Dogs_ takes place in an English village; the quaint sort you see in romantic comedies. But instead of charming, quirky characters, the residents of this hamlet are leering, hard-drinking thugs.\n\nInto this rural jungle comes mild-mannered American mathematician David (Dustin Hoffman) and his attractive wife Amy (Susan George). They're fleeing some vague unrest in America and the village is her childhood home.\n\nAs we meet David and Amy, we get our first indication the film will stray from the formula. They aren't the typical idyllic couple thrust into danger. David's condescending manner alienates the few locals who would befriend him but he's too self-absorbed to notice. His intellectual snobbery leads him to treat Amy like a child. Amy's petulant responses only reinforce the behavior. Their bickering rings true.\n\nThe plot kicks in when some local men, including a former boyfriend of Amy's, named Charlie, worm their way into a job repairing the couple's garage roof. The men drag out the work. They ogle Amy. One sneaks into the house and steals a pair of Amy's panties, which he later flaunts at the pub. Things reach a tipping point when David and Amy discover their cat hung in their bedroom closet. When David proves reluctant to confront the men, Amy presses the issue. David snaps at her. She calls him a coward.\n\nThis conflict between David and Amy sets up the film's most controversial scene: Charlie raping Amy.\n\nIt's a hard scene to watch. I've seen the film multiple times, and it doesn't get any easier. At first, Amy screams and fights back. Charlie slaps her and she crumbles to the floor in slow motion. Resigned to her fate, Amy stops fighting.\n\nThen Peckinpah twists the knife. He quick cuts between the present and Amy's intimate memories of David. Amy's anger toward David swirls and churns inside her. Her resignation turns to passion as she turns from victim to betrayer and embraces her former lover.\n\nFinally, as Amy and Charlie lay entwined, Peckinpah goes for the jugular. One of Charlie's goon friends enters, holding a shotgun. With some reluctance, Charlie steps aside and watches his friend force himself on Amy at gunpoint. Amy's shrieks surround us as her violation is absolute.\n\nControversial? Absolutely. Gratuitous? No. The scene is horrifying but necessary. It drives an unspoken wedge between David and Amy, setting up the rest of the story.\n\nThe finale sees Charlie and gang laying siege to David and Amy's house. It's a familiar scene in horror films; the men could just as easily be zombies or other monsters, and Peckinpah uses lots of low-angle shots and foggy backlighting. But the real horror isn't what's trying to get in, it's what's coming out between David and Amy.\n\nA series of plot-driven coincidences have led to David sheltering a mentally challenged man in the couple's attic. The mob outside believes this man murdered a local girl earlier that evening. When the attacks start, Amy urges David to acquiesce to the mob's demands and turn the man over, but David refuses. Bitter that David will stand up for a stranger but not her, Amy refuses to help. This proves the turning point in their relationship. Later, when Amy's in trouble, she yells for Charlie.\n\nIt's easy to dismiss _Straw Dogs_ as misogynistic, but that's short-sighted. This film hates everyone. While Amy is assaulted, David's out hunting with the very men who attack her. Of course, the trip was just a ruse to lure him away, but David only accepted to buddy-up with alpha-male Charlie. David would label himself a pacifist but behaves as a sycophant.\n\nAnd that goes to what makes the film special. It's violent, sure, but it's not the violence that stays with you. Rather, it's the bleak reflection of human nature. Horror movies tend to paint their protagonists as bland, cookie-cutter stereotypes; their misfortune born out of some trespass or bad luck. Not here.\n\nThe horror of _Straw Dogs_ isn't that it could _happen_ to us, it's that the characters could _be_ us. By committing to its bleak vision the film projects authority. By making its protagonists monsters themselves, the film transcends the exploitation genre. It may not be entertaining in the conventional sense, but every viewing stays with me for days.

And those are low standards.\n\nThe plot concerns\u2014well, I\u2019ve already mentioned the killer snowman, yes? Then, for most readers, I have described the plot in sufficient detail. For those still curious, the film opens with Federal agents transporting a serial killer (named Jack Frost, of course) to his execution. The icy conditions cause the paddy wagon to collide with a top-secret government tanker truck. The truck\u2019s contents spray out, melting the killer's skin and bones. His liquid remains merge with the snow, granting him a second life as a snowman.\n\nIt's a reasonable setup. The problem lies in the execution. Had the film played as a straight horror whose antagonist happens to be a snowman, it might have worked. Just imagine the absurdist humor in swapping Michael Myers for a snowman in _Halloween (1978)_. But _Jack Frost_ drowns in a sea of camera winks and awkward comedy bits. It\u2019s not a horror film, it\u2019s a manufactured attempt at \u201cso-bad-it\u2019s-good\u201d schlock.\n\nFor that approach to work, the titular killer snowman needs to be an anti-hero; someone we can perversely root for as he offs the self-centered jerk taking up two parking spaces during the holiday rush, the obnoxious boss who overworks his employees on Christmas Eve, and yes, even the ungrateful kid who\u2019s unhappy with his gifts.\n\n_Jack Frost_ offers no such vicarious thrills. The serial killer turned snowman is out to fulfill a petty revenge pact against the small-town sheriff who arrested him.

A young boy named Harry wanders downstairs and spies his father, dressed as Santa, fondling his half-naked mother.\n\n*I know, I said the film wasn't sleazy. Stay with me.*\n\nFast-forward thirty years and Harry (now played by Brandon Maggart) has developed an obsession with Santa. His shabby apartment overflows with Christmas knick-knacks and Santa artwork. He spies on the neighborhood children and catalogs their activities in large tomes dedicated to the naughty and nice. He even works in a dingy toy factory.\n\nOn Christmas Eve night, Harry dons his handmade Santa costume. At first, he's overjoyed as he delivers toys to children in a mental hospital. But then his attention turns to the naughty and his mood darkens. A chance confrontation turns violent and bloody. Harry flees, unsure what went wrong. He finds solace in a neighborhood Christmas party where he's the delight of the local children. But soon he's alone again, and the high of the party gives way to another dangerous low. More violence follows, spiraling out of control and leading to an outrageous finale that I dare not reveal, but which casts the film as a bittersweet fable.\n\nI admit, I went in expecting a cheesy bit of exploitation but I came out impressed. I liked the film's production. There's nary a soundstage in sight. Everything is location-based, including the New Jersey exteriors. The worn, lived-in interiors give the film a documentary veneer and added authenticity.\n\nBut most of all, I liked the film's willingness  to tell a different kind of story. It hit me during the third act, which sees Harry fleeing a mob of torch-wielding neighbors, that writer/director Lewis Jackson wasn't making a slasher picture at all, he was making a monster movie.\n\nConsider the similarities to _Frankenstein (1931)_. Both serve as cautionary tales. _Frankenstein_ warned against playing God. _Christmas Evil_ warns against playing Santa. It's a laughable notion until you consider it from a child's perspective. Moral absolutes like naughty and nice don't work in the adult world, but try explaining that to a child. The film commits to this premise.\n\nTo that end, Maggart's performance makes the film. His character is very much a child trapped in a middle-aged body, and Maggart convinces. The audience I saw the film with offered no snarky chuckles or giggles; they sat transfixed. Much as in _Frankenstein_, we come to care about this misunderstood monster. The script helps by ensuring Harry never harms a child. It reserves Harry's murderous outbursts for the film's real creeps: the other adults. It's an important detail that lets the film earn its ending.\n\nThe more I think about _Christmas Evil_, the more I admire it. Will it hold up to repeat viewings?

It's a film centered on an elaborate ruse perpetrated by lovable rogues. The genre peaked with _The Sting (1973)_, then gave way to the grittier heist genre. But while heists get bloody, capers are rarely life-and-death scenarios. Today, the caper picture lies largely forgotten, save the occasional farcical comedy. But director Steven Soderbergh proves the old genre has legs.\n\nThis film's lovable rogues come together to avenge their mentor (Elliott Gould) who's been double-crossed by casino mogul Willy Bank (Al Pacino).\n\nTo get even, the group plans to rob Bank's casino. The film's joy lies in how they go about it. The casino's security system offers only a three-and-a-half minute window. To circumvent this obstacle, the group will rig the games to pay out to everyone. The group needn't win, just for the casino to lose. So, for three-and-a-half minutes, everybody wins.\n\nOf course, folks don't leave when they're running hot and if they stay, they'll just lose back their winnings. The thieves' solution to this dilemma provides another of the film's quirky surprises.\n\nA lesser film might drag under such plotting, but _Ocean's Thirteen_ breezes along, thanks to its all-star cast. Opposite Pacino, George Clooney and Brad Pitt star as the lead thieves with Matt Damon as their de facto lieutenant. Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner, and Eddie Izzard round out the crew.\n\nThe performers relish the script's rapid-fire dialogue. Peppered with invented slang and meta references, it's the film's biggest treat, and holds up to repeat viewings. The first scene between Clooney and Pacino, with Clooney echoing Pacino's dialog from _The Godfather (1972)_ always makes me smile.\n\nBut my favorite scene is audacious. It opens with Pitt and Clooney strolling along the Las Vegas Strip, reminiscing. They stop and Clooney gestures off-camera, saying, \u201cI remember when this used to be the Dunes.\u201d\n\nPitt looks down the street, \u201cThe Sands was there, and the Desert Inn\u2026\u201d\n\nCut to a close-up. Both men stand lost in their memories.\n\nClooney says, \u201cThey built them a lot smaller back then.\u201d\n\nPitt, still looking where The Sands once stood, says, almost to himself, \u201cThey seemed pretty big.\u201d\n\nAnother beat, then Clooney says, \u201cTowns change,\u201d and Soderbergh cuts to a wide shot reveal of the Bellagio dwarfing Clooney and Pitt.\n\nI love this scene. Such self-indulgence should elicit a groan, but between the crackerjack editing and sheer charisma of his stars, Soderbergh gets away with it.

It's a remake of _The Land Beyond the Law (1927)_.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. acquired First National Pictures a few years prior, they inherited the rights to several popular silent westerns starring Ken Maynard. These were A-list productions showcasing Maynard's impressive stunt work.\n\nWarner Bros. sought to remake the Maynard silents with sound, recycling as much action footage as possible, reshooting only the close-ups and interiors. They just needed an actor who matched Maynard's build. Enter Wayne.\n\nExcept, _The Big Stampede_ doesn't offer much action. Wayne plays John Steele, a deputy lawman sent to clean up the New Mexico territory.\n\nHe arrives in town and poses as a drunken drifter while sizing up local cattle baron Sam Crew. Then John is on the frontier, befriending a wagon train leader named Cal and making eyes at Cal's niece Ginger. Then the train comes under attack from Sam Crew's gang. To apprehend the gang, John recruits Sonora Joe, a Mexican bandit who first tries to rustle the wagon train's cattle.\n\nIf this sounds disjointed, then I have conveyed the sense of watching this film. The script abandons plot threads with no regard for logic or continuity. It also contains an inordinate number of speaking parts.\n\nWhich begs the question: If the point of remaking the Maynard films was to save money, why shoot such a complex and talky script? Casting and shooting so much new footage cost time and money. The only memorable bit of recycled footage is the titular stampede, which provides the film's climax. The wide shots of rampaging cattle and runaway wagons impress. The spliced in close-ups of Wayne shouting things like \u201cHoo-ah!\u201d do not.\n\nSpeaking of Wayne, like much of the cast, he appears ill at ease.

It's that kind of movie.\n\nThe story concerns a college-aged punk rock band who accept a gig at an out-of-the-way club in the Pacific Northwest. I'll reveal no more, lest I spoil how writer/director Jeremy Saulnier ratchets up the tension by raising the stakes with each plot twist. Suffice it to say, things get very bad, very fast for the young band.\n\n_Green Room_ is Saulnier's third film. His debut, _Murder Party (2007)_, was a flawed but entertaining black comedy. His follow-up, _Blue Ruin (2013)_, was a near-perfect revenge thriller. With _Green Room_, he delivers one of the more intense horror films I've seen.\n\nFrom the moment the band turns into the club's parking lot, we feel uneasy. A palpable sense of menace hangs in the air. It grows as the kids make their way inside the club. By the time they take the stage, it's overwhelming.\n\nLesser horror films force their characters to behave in service of the plot. We spend such films yelling \u201cGet out of the house!\u201d or something similar at the idiots on screen.\n\n_Green Room_ doesn't do this. Saulnier's characters behave true to their established personalities. The kids sense something's off, but they stay anyway. In part because they're desperate for cash, but more so because they love playing music, and the film conveys the transcendent joy they experience on stage. Later, when things turn bad, the kids continue to react in a plausible and relatable manner. They don't panic or fall for obvious traps. They play it smart. Except\u2014and here lies the film's genius\u2014Saulnier paints his villains even smarter. They don't panic or make stupid mistakes either. It's all so refreshing.\n\nIt's also gruesome. Saulnier punctuates his plot twists with sudden, brutal bursts of violence driven home with convincing practical effects. It's not a gore-fest, but it's not for the squeamish either.\n\nThat's because Saulnier makes sure we care about his characters. Good effects suspend disbelief but good storytelling generates empathy. Saulnier's prior efforts demonstrated a knack for creating flawed but endearing protagonists and quickly fleshing them out without resorting to awkward exposition or trite visuals. In _Green Room_, he gives us a whole band full. He even avoids gender stereotypes.\n\nYou may have noticed that I have not mentioned the cast. They're all convincing and engaging, but discussing specific performances, or even the casting itself would invite spoilers. That said, I'll make one exception since the film's promotional artwork includes him.\n\nHow I envy the festival audiences who went in knowing little more than the film's title and director. Patrick Stewart's reveal as a neo-Nazi gang leader must have been a terrific surprise. He's an unconventional choice, but he pulls off the part. Granted, he's not as scary as say, Ben Kingsley in _Sexy Beast (2000)_ or Stacy Keach in _American History X (1998)_, but maybe that's a good thing. _Green Room_ is intense enough.", "slug": "green-room-2015"}, {"file_path": "reviews/men-are-such-fools-1938.md", "sequence": 76, "imdb_id": "tt0030433", "title": "Men Are Such Fools", "year": 1938, "date": "2017-01-30", "grade": "F", "review_content": "\nThe two-piece bathing suit isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nSure, it\u2019s good for a laugh.

Revisiting it for this review reaffirmed my opinion.\n\nPriscilla Lane stars as Linda, a secretary in an advertising agency who dreams of climbing the corporate ladder and drawing a salary instead of wages.\n\nJust as her career takes off, she marries Jimmy, played by Wayne Morris. Jimmy is an ex-footballer from Princeton turned ad-man. When Linda works overtime and misses the big Princeton football game, Jimmy demands Linda quit her job. Linda agrees, and several months later they\u2019ve settled into a bland suburban existence with Linda playing the role of dutiful housewife.\n\nStill ambitious, Linda arranges a promising business venture for Jimmy, but Jimmy turns it down. Furious, Linda leaves Jimmy and resumes her career. Soon, she\u2019s near the top of the ladder, working long nights alongside fellow advertising executive Harry, played by Bogart.\n\nDespondent, Jimmy throws himself into his work and achieves a large measure of success. As Harry makes his feelings for Linda clear, Linda realizes she\u2019ll have to choose between Harry and Jimmy. She chooses poorly.\n\nRomantic comedies require us to like at least one of the leads. In _Men Are Such Fools_, I loathed them both.\n\nJimmy displays no regard for Linda\u2019s dreams and ambitions, behaving as though he\u2019s entitled to her attention and affection. When Linda cancels a dinner date with Jimmy to sell her boss on an ad campaign, Jimmy crashes the meeting. When a senior executive talks to Linda at a party, Jimmy sulks in a corner rather than join in the conversation. And don\u2019t forget Linda's near-unforgivable crime of missing the Princeton game with Jimmy and his fraternity buddies.\n\nJimmy\u2019s so chauvinistic it\u2019s almost comical. But everyone in the film acts as though his behavior is acceptable. They laugh and chalk it up to young love. That\u2019s when you realize it\u2019s not Jimmy who\u2019s supposed to be funny, but Linda for prioritizing her career over a man.\n\nWhich brings us to Linda, who I loathed even more than Jimmy. You see, she doesn\u2019t endure his behavior, she encourages it. Consider how Jimmy gets her to marry him. They\u2019re at a pool party thrown by one of Linda\u2019s bosses. Linda\u2019s talking to a high level executive. Furious that Linda would dare talk to another man, Jimmy stalks across the party, grabs Linda, pulls her into the pool and demands she marry him. When Linda says no, he pushes her head under water. He waits a beat, then lets her up. As Linda gasps for air, Jimmy repeats his demand. Again she says no. Back under she goes. This repeats\u2014in full view of the guests, most of whom are Linda's superiors at work\u2014until Linda agrees. And when she does, it\u2019s not with resentment, but with a doe-eyed smile full of adoration for this man who just bullied her into marrying him. Now, I ask you, who\u2019s worse: the ass or the woman who reinforces the behavior?\n\nI was going to write something about the ending, and how it lacks a clear message, leaving you wondering just what the film was trying to say, but why bother? There\u2019s only one way to enjoy _Men Are Such Fools_: 1. Start the movie. 2. Fast-forward to Bogart\u2019s introduction. 3. Laugh at his outfit. 4. Turn off the movie.

Walking the streets one night, Sam passes an art gallery. Glancing inside, he spies a mysterious black-clad assailant attacking a woman with a knife. Unable to gain entry, Sam stands helpless as the attacker escapes and the woman lies bleeding on the floor pleading for help.\n\nHaunted by his memories, Sam joins the investigation, causing the killer to target him and his live-in girlfriend, played by Suzy Kendall.\n\nArgento's visual style grabs you from the get-go. Consider the art gallery scene. The establishing shot sees a bright light shining out of the building's glass facade, drawing our eyes along with Sam's. Inside, the woman's white dress blends with the white walls and floor, forcing our gaze to the black-clad assailant and the woman's crimson blood.\n\nIt's a terrific use of contrast; a technique that Argento perfects in my favorite shot, which I shall endeavor to describe. It occurs later in the film, Sam has tracked the killer into a darkened room. As Sam enters, Argento cuts to a wide shot. The only light comes from the doorway. Sam's silhouette moves to the center of the otherwise pitch-black screen. Then the lights come on and the colors reverse to startling effect. That Argento would even try such a tricky shot shows his confidence. That he pulls it off heralds a major talent.\n\nBut Argento's visual focus can also be a detriment, particularly when he treats his characters as props rather than people. The most grievous example comes when Suzy Kendall's character finds herself under siege by the killer. She flees into her apartment and locks and barricades the heavy door. She looks for another way out. Finding none, she crumbles to the bathroom floor and sobs hysterically while the killer stabs at the apartment door.\n\nSure, Argento gets some memorable shots of a wide-eyed Kendall clinging to the bathroom sink, but the scene lost me. By having her scour the apartment for an exit, Argento reveals the lack of another _entry_. After locking and barricading the door, she need only grab a weapon and wait. Granted, it might be a long wait\u2014boring through inches of hardwood with a kitchen knife takes time\u2014but should the killer poke a limb through, she could stab or bludgeon it. Instead, Argento has her wail around on the floor as though the killer were literally breathing down her neck. What begins tense and stylish, drags and devolves into overwrought indulgence.\n\nThis illustrates a fundamental misconception on Argento's part: that showing us a terrified character is enough to make _us_ terrified.

That's it. It doesn't pretend to have a deeper purpose or meaning. It's all shock for shock's sake.\n\nAnd yet, it's surprisingly well done. Mastorakis makes terrific use of the photogenic locales and enlivens the over-the-top violence with inventive camerawork. Consider the nocturnal chase through the city's labyrinthine alleys. Mastorakis heightens the sense of panic by using a fish-eye lens and several low-angles shots from the victim's point-of-view. In a lesser film, such choices would feel gimmicky, but they work here.\n\nThe assured photography contrasts with the uneven performances. Though the supporting players are either wooden or over-the-top, Behling and Lyle play their parts so straight they verge on camp. As parody, the performances are inspired. Behling's delivery alone is priceless.\n\nBy his own account, Mastorakis made _Island of Death_ after seeing _The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)_. That film's box-office success lead him to believe an even more extreme picture would make even more money. This naked ambition manifests in an everything-but-the-kitchen sink approach that pushes the film past any genuine scares or mean-spirited umbrage, and firmly into parody. Were I to enumerate the film's assorted affronts to good taste it would appear brutal, yet I came away entertained. _Island of Death_ isn't for everyone, but exploitation fans will love it.\n", "slug": "island-of-death-1976"}, {"file_path": "reviews/the-telegraph-trail-1933.md", "sequence": 82, "imdb_id": "tt0024647", "title": "The Telegraph Trail", "year": 1933, "date": "2017-03-13", "grade": "D", "review_content": "\nYoung John Wayne gets his best supporting cast in years, but the resulting picture still stinks.\n\n_The Telegraph Trail_ was the fourth production, following _The Big Stampede (1932)_, under a six-picture contract Wayne signed with Warner Bros.

Everything is not fine.\n\nForgive my not revealing more but, as Roger Ebert often said, it's not what the film is about, but how it is about it. With _Get Out_, writer/director Jordan Peele offers a horror film that's a meditation on racism in America, but not how you'd expect.

I can't spoil the scene; it's too good. But consider how Peele embraces the trope of drawing the protagonist into a spooky situation. Chris doesn't investigate an odd noise, or similar clunky idiot plot behavior, his motives feel organic. As for what he sees, well, it's scary, bizarre and humorous all at once. Peele leverages the setup's inherent suspense and channels it into an original payoff. It's genre Aikido.\n\nIndeed, aside from Rose's brother's part feeling underwritten or severely edited, the film shines. It's not until the third act, when the film's cards are on the table, that it falters. We've grown so enamored with Peele's ability to repurpose the genre's staples, that it feels like a letdown when he indulges in a few.\n\nOn this point, I'm torn. I love the third act's gleefully gory, over the top nature, but it feels like a safety net. Like a comedian following a raw emotional truth with a punchline.

The vampires bicker over household chores, dress for a night out, and prepare dinner for their would-be victims. In these moments, the film shines.

Holly isn't a real person, she's a ghost, drifting in and out of people's lives, leaving an indelible impression. That Paul could end up with her doesn't ring true.

Amid the chaos of the police chasing everyone out, Rick demands an explanation:\n\n>LOUIS  \nI'm shocked, SHOCKED, to find gambling going on here!\n\n>(A croupier approaches with a large wad of cash)\n\n>CROUPIER  \nYour winnings sir.\n\n>LOUIS  \nOh, thank you, very much!\n\nThat's not just funny, it's Billy Wilder funny.\n\nBut the film pivots with ease. Grounded in relatable emotions, the melodrama packs a punch. Consider how Rick spits venom at Ilsa:\n\n>Well, I guess neither one of our stories is very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Lazlo, or were there others in between or\u2026 aren't you the kind that tells?\n\nNo weepy speeches, just relatable emotion setup by an earlier scene between a drunken Rick and Sam:\n\n>SAM  \nLet's get outta here.\n\n>RICK  \nNo Sam, I'm waiting for a lady.\n\n>SAM  \nPlease boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.\n\n>RICK (staring at the liquor in front of him)  \nShe's coming back. I know she's coming back.\n\n>SAM  \nWe'll take the car. We'll drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.\n\n>RICK (not looking at Sam)  \nShut up and go home, will ya?\n\n>SAM  \nNo sir, I'm staying right here.\n\nGreat lines abound but some of the film's best moments are visual. I didn't discover them until years later, when I finally sat down and watched the film. Nice touches like when the waiter checks his pockets after the pickpocket bumps him. Or the beat-perfect editing between Rick and Louis during the finale. \n\nAnd let's talk about that ending. It's not a happy one. Rick sends the love of his life away and goes off to a likely death. Noble? Absolutely. But in an era where studios were allergic to unhappy endings, it's amazing this one went over.\n\nFurther, it's impressive how the script doesn't have Ilsa waffle, even when she believes Rick has betrayed Victor. This casts her in an unflattering light, but gives the ending its resonance.\n\nI was a movie buff before _Casablanca_. It's what got me the video store job. But _Casablanca_ made me a Bogart fan, which led me to _The Big Sleep (1946)_ and _The Maltese Falcon (1941)_, which led me to _The Thin Man (1934)_, along with the films of John Huston and Howard Hawks, which led me to the films of William Powell and John Wayne, which led me to _Rio Bravo (1959)_, and well\u2026 you get the idea. _Casablanca_ changed my life.\n\nAnd I'm not alone.

Years earlier, a small Nova Scotian mining town saw a cave-in trap several miners. The men on watch were AWOL at a Valentine's Day party, forcing the lone survivor to resort to cannibalism. Following his rescue, the survivor donned his mining gear and murdered the negligent men. The town hasn't celebrated Valentine's Day since.\n\nFlash-forward.

The mayor and sheriff keep the killings under wraps and cancel the party. The frustrated miners move the party to the mine. Soon, the youngsters find themselves trapped underground with the killer.\n\nLike _Friday the 13th (1980)_, the story revolves around a tragedy of neglect born of indulgence. In a subtle nod, the film sets Valentine's Day on a Saturday, making the preceding Friday the 13th. Like _Halloween (1978)_ it features a holiday theme. But _My Bloody Valentine_ eschews wooded cabins or suburban homes and substitutes a dank, dark, coal mine. It's an inspired choice that works thanks to the location photography. Another inspired choice is the script's allowance for multiple survivors. By avoiding the \"final girl\" trope, the film avoids the contrived plotting that goes into whittling a group, despite the natural human impulse to stick together.\n\nIndeed, as an 80's slasher, the only things working against the film are the Nova Scotian accents.

Prior to that, I strove to review every film I saw. Keeping pace with my movie-watching habit meant cranking out reviews at a relentless pace. \n\nWith the relaunch, I focused on quality over quantity. A good review describes the film and the experience watching it. As Roger Ebert said:\n\n> In other words, if it is a Pauly Shore comedy, there are people who like them, and they should be able to discover in your review if the new one is down to their usual standard.\n\nThat's the goal. A cursory look through my last 100 reviews reveals ample failures. Good writers show rather than tell. Too often, I present my opinion as fact instead of building a case for the reader to arrive at the same conclusion. \n\n\nConsider this line, from my review of _Mal\u00e9fique (2002)_:\n\n> As Carr\u00e8re, G\u00e9rald Laroche provides a grounded audience surrogate whose gradual transformation into a bitter convict carries the film.\n\nWhat does that mean? How does it carry the film?\n\nOr this bit, from my review of _Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961)_:\n\n> Patricia Neal plays the rich, married woman who pays Paul's rent and keeps him in nice clothes. She makes an impression by underplaying her role.\n\nHow does she underplay the role?\n\nOr from my review of _Giallo a Venezia (1979)_:\n\n> The murders\u2014particularly the prostitute's\u2014are uninspired and ugly.\n\nWhat makes them uninspired and ugly? I'm not describing the murders, I'm describing my reaction to them, but not calling that out as opinion.\n\nAnd consider the outright nonsense I've written, like the closing line from my review of _Interstellar (2014)_:\n\n> Interstellar doesn\u2019t transcend the science fiction genre, it abandons it.\n\nLines like that make me wonder if I'm wasting my time. True, practice makes perfect, but practice requires feedback.\n\nStephen King writes for his wife. My wife provides great feedback but I have to petition her to read my work. She doesn't like my style. I could take that as feedback in itself, but I've read reviews she _does_ enjoy and _I_ don't like them. \n\nI've tried soliciting feedback via comments. The few replies I received spoke to my opinions, not the writing itself. Fair enough, considering the site's homepage receives little traffic compared to the individual reviews. \n\nIt's time I admit it: Constant Reader, you don't exist.\n\nSo why bother? \n\nI ask myself that a lot.\n\nThe answer is my daughters. Neither is old enough to read, but they're my audience. At least, their future selves. At my current pace, I'll have written several hundred reviews by the time they're old enough to watch R-rated movies. By the time they're my age, statistics say I'll be dead. \n\nWhich makes my failures as a writer all the more painful. But I still have time. Tomorrow's rewrite can fix today's shortfall. Provided I solve the feedback problem. \n\nBut back to _Rio Bravo_.\n\nJohn Wayne stars as John T. Chance, sheriff of Presidio County, Texas. He's holding Joe Burdette for murder. Joe's brother, Nathan, is a wealthy land baron. Nathan recruits a slew of mercenaries to free Joe. Chance's allies consist of his drunken deputy Dude, played by Dean Martin, a crippled old curmudgeon named Stumpy, played by Walter Brennan, a young gunslinger named Colorado, played by Ricky Nelson, and a showgirl turned gambler named Feathers, played by Angie Dickinson. \n\nThe script establishes the premise in the first ten minutes, with almost no dialog. From there, the film unfolds at a languid pace. There are flashes of action, but much of the film sees the cast sitting or standing around indoors, talking or reacting to one-another.\n\nHere is where I falter. I'm not sure why the film works so well. I can point to the charisma of Wayne and Martin, but that's only part of it. The film speaks to something deeper. A good chunk of the film revolves around Chance rehabilitating Dude. Chance doesn't coddle him, but it's not \"tough love\" either. Chance believes Dude will come around. For Dude, the desire to live up to that faith is stronger than any addiction.\n\nIt's a wonderful male fantasy, and for two hours and change, we believe it. Chance is an idealized big-brother/father figure. He's the strong, honest, capable, professional man we want to be. Dude is the flawed, vulnerable man we feel we are. Chance's faith in Dude is Chance's faith in us. Watching _Rio Bravo_ is a low-key cathartic experience. The most powerful scenes are wordless or book-ended with comic relief. It's not a heavy film, but it punches above its weight.\n\nAnd about the comic relief. Much of it comes via Walter Brennan's character, but repeat viewings have lent a comedic shade to many of Wayne's lines. Like Billy Wilder's best films, _Rio Bravo_ uses comedy as a subtle distraction. When Chance says, \"Sorry don't get it done Dude,\" we smirk at the delivery but feel the message.\n\nI'm closing in on a thousand words and I haven't touched on Angie Dickinson's performance or Dimitri Tiomkin's score. I could devote a couple hundred words to each and not do them justice.\n\nIndeed, one could write a book analyzing the film but I suspect only the author would enjoy it. _Rio Bravo_ taps into emotions it never acknowledges. We interpret the undercurrents based on our own experiences. Over-explaining things would force a singular interpretation and alienate the reader. \n\nOr maybe I'm trying to justify my shortcomings as a writer. \n\nYou tell me.", "slug": "rio-bravo-1959"}, {"file_path": "reviews/the-sister-of-ursula-1978.md", "sequence": 102, "imdb_id": "tt0078300", "title": "The Sister of Ursula", "year": 1978, "date": "2017-08-14", "grade": "F", "review_content": "\nPart soft-core porn.

Ursula begs Dagmar to leave, claiming visions of a horrible future. With heavy sighs, Dagmar dismisses Ursula's pleadings. Ursula pouts. Instead of establishing a forbidding atmosphere, the scene left me cold to Ursula's petulant behavior. \n\nDagmar convinces Ursula to accompany her to the hotel nightclub. There we meet the supporting players: the hotel manager, a sultry nightclub singer, and a pretty-boy gigolo. Dagmar feels a connection to the gigolo, but Ursula insists he's dangerous. More sighs and dismissals from Dagmar.\n\nAs the film goes on, a pattern emerges. The script introduces either a character who has sex with a supporting player or a pair of characters who have sex with each other. A mysterious black-gloved figure watches the copulating couple from the shadows. After some late-night-cable-grade soft-core erotica, the black-gloved figure kills one or both of the lovers. Aside from a slashed throat, the violence occurs off-screen. \n\nThe script offers few red herrings. Instead, it doles out assorted subplots including the sisters' search for their estranged mother, the hotel manager's struggles with his estranged wife, and the gigolo's drug habit. \n\nNone of these threads held my interest. But the film's reputation as a sleazy giallo had me certain it would veer into crazy territory. \n\nIt proved a long wait. During the finale, after an unsurprising reveal of the killer's identity, we see the murder weapon. Spoiler\u2014it's a giant phallus.

Mark, played by Sam Neill, returns home to West Berlin and discovers his wife Anna, played by Isabelle Adjani, has checked out of their marriage. Neill and Adjani over-emote in performances ripped from a daytime soap opera. And yet, their scenes with their kindergarten-age son, Bob, feel restrained and true.

This\u2026 _thing_ exhibits powerful psychic abilities, possessing the mind of anyone around it.\n\nThe monster requires human flesh (or blood?) to grow, leading Anna to murder a series of interlopers, including her former lover, and a detective hired by Mark.\n\nOnce the bodies pile up, the film catches up to Neill and Adjani's performances. Now their manic behavior feels appropriate. It's a subtle trick I didn't catch until my second viewing. Watching _Possession_ in a theater, the audience\u2014full of wry snickers early on\u2014sat riveted in silence by this point.\n\nAnd I haven't mentioned Anna's doppelg\u00e4nger or the scene where Anna\u2014oozing blood and slime from every orifice\u2014miscarries the tentacle monster's offspring in a deserted subway corridor.\n\nWhat is \u017bu\u0142awski saying? Between the talk of God and reoccurring shots of the Berlin Wall, _Possession_ remains a mystery. One that sticks with me for days. Is it the mix of nihilism and the supernatural? Perhaps.
