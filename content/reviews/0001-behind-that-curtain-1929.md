Boris Karloff's first sound picture sees him with a bit part as lead Warner Baxter's vaguely Arabian manservant. It's billed as a mystery[^1] but plays as a melodrama with Baxter and Lois Moran as would-be lovers if not for Moran's murderous, philandering husband.

Director Irving Cummings has flashes of inspiration--I loved the early long shot of Baxter standing alone in a suddenly quiet foyer--but the early limitations of sound rendered the camera inert.

The performances mirror the direction. Baxter and Moran show flashes of charisma but their baseline is a bland stiffness might have gone unnoticed on stage but is amplified by the camera.

What really irked me though, was Moran's character, whose agency is an illusion, as every choice she makes is inexplicable and only serves to drag out the running time. That said, I did chuckle at the end when her character admits as much.

[^1]: This is technically Fox's first Charlie Chan picture, though the character himself doesn't appear until the 75-minute mark and even then in little more than a bit-cameo.
