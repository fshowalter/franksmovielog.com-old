It's another of those gruesome thrillers in which the killer has spared no effort to fabricate an elaborate plot for the benefit, really, of the screenplay more than for himself. Horrible things happen, fearful paradoxes are explored, and although it's well-acted (especially by Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell as the two men) and well made by director James Wan, it's a machine for manufacturing suspense and has no interior life.\n", "slug": "blackmail-1929"}]
